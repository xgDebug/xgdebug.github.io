      <description>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit of Financial Discipline:&lt;/strong&gt; Become someone who practices disciplined financial management. This could involve habits such as creating a budget, tracking expenses, and avoiding unnecessary spending.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit of Continuous Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; Embrace the identity of a lifelong learner in the realm of personal finance. Make it a habit to read books, articles, and attend seminars on financial literacy and investment strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit of Savvy Investing:&lt;/strong&gt; Cultivate the identity of an informed and strategic investor. Regularly set aside time to research investment opportunities and make informed decisions about where to invest your money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit of Goal Setting:&lt;/strong&gt; Adopt the identity of a goal-oriented individual. Set clear financial goals and break them down into actionable steps. Regularly review and adjust your goals as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit of Networking and Relationship Building:&lt;/strong&gt; Become someone who actively seeks out connections in the financial world. Network with professionals, mentors, and like-minded individuals who can provide guidance and opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit of Entrepreneurial Thinking:&lt;/strong&gt; Develop an identity that embraces entrepreneurial thinking. This might involve exploring side businesses, investments in startups, or other ventures that can diversify your income streams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit of Long-Term Planning:&lt;/strong&gt; Embody the identity of a strategic planner. Develop a habit of thinking about your financial future in the long term, which includes retirement planning, estate planning, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit of Resilience:&lt;/strong&gt; Cultivate the identity of a resilient individual who learns from setbacks. Financial success often involves facing challenges; adopting the habit of bouncing back and learning from failures is crucial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit of Generosity:&lt;/strong&gt; Adopt the identity of someone who values giving back. Allocate a portion of your financial success to charitable causes, reinforcing the idea that financial success enables positive impact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit of Risk Management:&lt;/strong&gt; Become someone who is conscious of financial risks. Develop habits of managing and mitigating risks through insurance, emergency funds, and thoughtful decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit of Negotiation and Assertiveness:&lt;/strong&gt; Embrace an identity of someone who advocates for their financial interests. Develop the habit of negotiating for better deals, raises, and terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the key is to start small and build gradually. Choose one or a few of these habits that resonate with you and incorporate them into your daily routine. As you consistently practice these habits, they will become ingrained in your identity, leading to more sustainable and impactful changes in your financial life. Over time, these small identity-based habits can accumulate and lead to significant financial success.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks into teaching on a full-time schedule, she noticed things that started as nuisances but quickly became painful problems. The teaching part of her job was great and fun, but certain formalities took way too much additional time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We found out that many other teachers did the same when they started talking about their self-built solutions in their online communities. Teachers began to share their templates through Google sheets. It was clear that this was a shared problem in a very tight-knit community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a sizeable market with an apparent, shared, and critical problem. The problem was solvable, but no one had yet built anything to make it noticeably easier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, we released it to the public, built a landing page, and waited. Nothing happened. One or two people signed up for the free trial, but there was not much else. We hadn&amp;rsquo;t done any marketing, and we hadn&amp;rsquo;t made any sales. The service just sat there, idling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;And then, one day, everything changed. In a comment to a Facebook post about how teachers dealt with feedback, Danielle dropped the link to our product with an explanation of how she used it. Teachers started to respond, asking for more details, they checked out the program, and came back to share their newly found discovery on social media.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For many of our customers, teaching from home was a side hustle. Using our product enabled many of them to turn this into a full-time source of income. We priced our service to be affordable and easily justified. We even increased our prices by 50% a year into running the business, and it continued growing nevertheless.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;that fueled the growth of our business from its first few users to thousands of customers a couple of months later. It was surreal, but we had tapped into a highly active tribe. Once we understood that, we didn&amp;rsquo;t need to do much when it came to marketing our product: our users would do most of that for us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tech founders—and I count myself as one—focus on products because that is what we use to solve our problems. After all, when you run into a challenging task, what do you look for first? An in-depth scientific explanation for the epistemological essence of the task? Or a tool that will do the job for you seconds after you install it?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many successful bootstrapped businesses start with an audience, a specific niche. They find their customers&amp;rsquo; critical problems and provide valuable solutions that people gladly pay for. Their product is centered around continuously providing value to new and existing customers. Audience, problem, solution, and product can be looked at individually.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Successful businesses are built by solving critical problems for an audience that will pay for a solution to their issues. The Preparation Stage is when you make these foundational choices. Once in motion, a business has certain inertia that makes these decisions hard to change. Even though pivoting your business into new markets is sometimes the right choice, it’s extra effort. That’s why it’s a good idea to spend considerable time on getting it right in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The world is full of opportunities to make other people’s lives better in some way, and your job as a businessperson is to identify things that people don’t have enough of, then find a way to provide them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Think about what product or service society wants but does not yet know how to get. You want to become the person who delivers it and delivers it at scale. That is really the challenge of how to make money. Now, the problem is becoming good at whatever “it” is. It moves around from generation to generation, but a lot of it happens to be in technology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most interesting and the most important form of leverage is the idea of products that have no marginal cost of replication. This is the new form of leverage. This was only invented in the last few hundred years. It started with the printing press. It accelerated with broadcast media, and now it’s really blown up with the internet and with coding. Now, you can multiply your efforts without involving other humans and without needing money from other humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>There are three broad classes of leverage</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One form of leverage is labor—other humans working for you. It is the oldest form of leverage, and actually not a great one in the modern world. [1] I would argue this is the worst form of leverage that you could possibly use. Managing other people is incredibly messy. It requires tremendous leadership skills. You’re one short hop from a mutiny or getting eaten or torn apart by the mob. [78] Money is good as a form of leverage. It means every time you make a decision, you multiply it with money. [1] Capital is a trickier form of leverage to use. It’s more modern. It’s the one that people have used to get fabulously wealthy in the last century. It’s probably been the dominant form of leverage in the last century. You can see this by looking for the richest people. It’s bankers, politicians in corrupt countries who print money, essentially people who move large amounts of money around. If you look at the top of very large companies, outside of technology companies, in many, many large old companies, the CEO job is really a financial job. It scales very, very well. If you get good at managing capital, you can manage more and more capital much more easily than you can manage more and more people. The final form of leverage is brand new—the most democratic form. It is: “products with no marginal cost of replication.” This includes books, media, movies, and code. Code is probably the most powerful form of permissionless leverage. All you need is a computer—you don’t need anyone’s permission.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Probably the most interesting thing to keep in mind about new forms of leverage is they are permissionless. They don’t require somebody else’s permission for you to use them or succeed. For labor leverage, somebody has to decide to follow you. For capital leverage, somebody has to give you money to invest or to turn into a product.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever you can in life, optimize for independence rather than pay. If you have independence and you’re accountable on your output, as opposed to your input—that’s the dream. &lt;br&gt;
A leveraged worker can out-produce a non-leveraged worker by a factor of one thousand or ten thousand. With a leveraged worker, judgment is far more important than how much time they put in or how hard they work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Compound interest is a very powerful concept. Compound interest applies to more than just compounding capital. Compounding capital is just the beginning.&lt;br&gt;
Compound interest also happens in your reputation.&lt;br&gt;
If you have a sterling reputation and you keep building it for decades upon decades, people will notice.&lt;br&gt;
Your reputation will literally end up being thousands or tens of thousands of times more valuable than somebody else who was very talented but is not keeping the compound interest in reputation going.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wealth is the thing you want. Wealth is&lt;br&gt;
the factory, the robots, cranking out things. Wealth is the computer program that’s running at night, serving other customers. Wealth is even money in the bank that is being reinvested into other assets, and into other businesses. Even a house can be a form of wealth, because you can rent it out, although that’s probably a lower productivity use of land than some commercial enterprise.&lt;br&gt;
So, my definition of wealth is much more businesses and assets that can earn while you sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There’s not really that much to fear in terms of failure, and so people should take on a lot more accountability than they do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>You’re not going to get rich renting out your time.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s ownership versus wage work. If you are paid for renting out your time, even lawyers and doctors, you can make some money, but you’re not going to make the money that&lt;br&gt;
gives you financial freedom. You’re not going to have passive income where a business is earning for you while you are on vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without ownership, your inputs are very closely tied to your outputs. In almost any salaried job, even one paying a lot per hour like a lawyer or a doctor, you’re still putting in the hours, and every hour you get paid.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Without ownership, your inputs are very closely tied to your outputs. In almost any salaried job, even one paying a lot per hour like a lawyer or a doctor, you’re still putting in the hours, and every hour you get paid.</p>
<p>Without ownership, when you’re sleeping, you’re not earning. When you’re retired, you’re not earning. When you’re on vacation, you’re not earning. And you can’t earn nonlinearly.</p>
<p>Essentially, you’re working for somebody else, and that person is taking on the risk and has the accountability, the intellectual property, and the brand. They’re not going to pay you enough. They’re going to pay you the bare minimum they have to, to get you to do their job. That can be a high bare minimum, but it’s still not going to be true wealth where you’re retired but still earning. [78] Owning equity in a company basically means you own the upside. When you own debt, you own guaranteed revenue streams and you own the downside. You want to own equity. If you don’t own equity in a business, your odds of making money are very slim. You have to work up to the point where you can own equity in a business. You could own equity as a small shareholder where you bought stock. You could also own it as an owner where you started the company. Ownership is really important.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I only really want to do things for their own sake. That is one definition of art. Whether it’s business, exercise, romance, friendship, whatever, I think the meaning of life is to do things for their own sake. Ironically, when you do things for their own sake, you create your best work. Even if you’re just trying to make money, you will actually be the most successful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mental models are concepts that represent your understanding of how something in the world works. Think of driving a car: What do you expect when you press down on the right-side pedal? If the car slows down, you’ll be surprised—that pedal is supposed to be the accelerator. The accuracy of your model of the world determines your expectations, decisions, behavior, and—in the long run—your results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s not really about hard work.&lt;br&gt;
You can work in a restaurant eighty hours a week, and you’re not going to get rich.&lt;br&gt;
Getting rich is about knowing what to do, who to do it with, and when to do it.&lt;br&gt;
It is much more about understanding than purely hard work.&lt;br&gt;
Yes, hard work matters, and you can’t skimp on it.&lt;br&gt;
But it has to be directed in the right way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Seek wealth, not money or status.&lt;br&gt;
Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep.&lt;br&gt;
Money is how we transfer time and wealth.&lt;br&gt;
Status is your place in the social hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignore people playing status games.&lt;br&gt;
They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re not going to get rich renting out your time.&lt;br&gt;
You must own equity—a piece of a business—to gain your financial freedom.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seek wealth, not money or status.<br>
Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep.<br>
Money is how we transfer time and wealth.<br>
Status is your place in the social hierarchy.</p>
<p>Ignore people playing status games.<br>
They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.</p>
<p>You’re not going to get rich renting out your time.<br>
You must own equity—a piece of a business—to gain your financial freedom.</p>
<p>You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.</p>
<p>Pick an industry where you can play long-term games with long-term people.</p>
<p>The internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven’t figured this out yet.</p>
<p>↓ Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.<br>
↓ Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity.<br>
↓ Don’t partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.<br>
↓ Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.<br>
↓ Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.<br>
↓ Specific knowledge is knowledge you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else and replace you.<br>
↓ Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.<br>
↓ Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others.<br>
↓ When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, not schools.<br>
↓ Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.<br>
↓Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.<br>
↓ “Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.” —Archimedes<br>
↓ Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).<br>
↓ Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge with accountability and show resulting good judgment.<br>
↓ Labor means people working for you. It’s the oldest and most fought-over form of<br>
leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it.<br>
↓ Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.<br>
↓ Code and media are permissionless leverage. They’re the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.<br>
↓ An army of robots is freely available—it’s just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it.<br>
↓ If you can’t code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts.<br>
↓Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgment.<br>
↓ Judgment requires experience but can be built faster by learning foundational skills.<br>
↓ There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes.<br>
↓ Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.<br>
↓ Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.<br>
↓ You should be too busy to “do coffee” while still keeping an uncluttered calendar.<br>
↓Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it.<br>
↓ Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work.<br>
↓ Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.<br>
↓ There are no get-rich-quick schemes. Those are just someone else getting rich off you.<br>
↓ Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve.<br>
↓When you’re finally wealthy, you’ll realize it wasn’t what you were seeking in the first place. But that is for another day.</p>
