      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;痛点&#34;&gt;痛点&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hugo 是一款很好用的静态网站生成框架,很多人用它来写 Blog,并且部署在 github pages 上，但是这个方案只能在电脑上使用，每次要写文章都需要打开电脑。 我强烈的需要一个时刻都能记录自己思考的方案,在思绪飞扬时打开手机就能马上把它记录下来。所以也就需要一款能在手机上操作的 APP。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;成功的敌人不是失败，而是无趣与无聊，所以我们必须让它有趣。 做产品也是一样，必须一开始就有人用，有互动，有反馈，否则你坚持不下去的。一定要从一开始就有种子用户，开发中的时候就有一个群的人在期待。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;1. Do consumers recognize that they have the problem you are trying to solve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. If there was a solution, would they buy it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Would they buy it from us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Can we build a solution for that problem?” The common tendency of product development is to skip straight to the fourth question and build a solution before confirming that customers have the problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

事实上，一旦有了框架，接下来只要填满就行了。&lt;br&gt;
反之，如果没框架就直接去思考其中的细节,那就不得不面对一堆未经梳理的凌乱信息，白白浪费时间。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You built a solution for customers who think they have that problem under control. You solved the wrong problem. You developed a solution that helps only at the margins. You solved the wrong problem. You built something, but your customers have bigger fish to fry. You solved the wrong problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You want to build a “need-to-have” instead of a “nice-to-have.” You want to develop a painkiller instead of a vitamin. You want to be their aspirin. How can this be done?

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most crucial problem a customer faces is on their minds most often. It’s the most important because it’s coming up frequently and is never easy to solve. It has the most impact on their lives, but it’s not always the obvious choice. If you can help a customer with their most critical problem, they will benefit the most.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Critical Problem Is Painful Problems can be a nuisance. They come up, and you either deal with them or ignore them. We can’t ignore critical problems. They persistently make the lives of those who have them harder until they are resolved. They can’t be just ignored, because they consistently reduce the quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Find the critical problem where people need to do the same thing over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Critical Problem Occurs Frequently and Repeatedly The reason why critical problems are always on the minds of your customers is that the problems happen so often. Every day, every week, every month, the critical problems repeatedly occur. For your customers, it’s always the most urgent thing at that time. The issue needs to be solved there and then, every single time. If it’s not frequent, it is likely not a critical problem. If it occurs repeatedly and isn’t easily solved, it is likely to be a critical problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Find the critical problem where solving a problem takes a long time every time the problem occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Critical Problem Takes up Too Much Time If a problem can be solved quickly, people either solve it the moment it appears or they set aside some time to do the work in a batch later, without feeling like it’s a waste of time. If that is the case, the problem is not really critical. Only when you need to spend considerable time and effort each time you solve the problem will it be impossible to “just” deal with it. “Doing it later” also turns into a chore, as it may take hours or days to deal with a long queue of deferred problems. A critical problem will feel like an unwelcome chore: important, yet tiresome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;They Have No Interest in Paying With non-critical problems, customers often find alternative ways of solving the problem because they want to save money. It’s not worthwhile for them to look for and pay for a solution that they value less than alternative solutions.&lt;br&gt;
They’ll be willing to pay: if the solution saves them time if the solution saves them money if the solution makes them money&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Critical Problem Forces People to Solve It Using Their Own System There is the joke that every SaaS is an Excel sheet transformed into business logic. The moment someone uses generic tools like word processors or spreadsheets to solve a problem, it’s an indicator that the problem is valuable enough to build tools. Most problems don’t have high complexity, and they can be solved on the spot. But a critical issue will be complicated enough to start developing a system. If your customers have a pile of Post-its or a chaotic assortment of Word and Excel files to solve a problem, you may have found a critical problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finding the Critical Problem So, how can you learn about which is the most critical problem your customers have? It’s quite straightforward: talk to them. Ask them what annoys them most. Find out where they want to be. Ask them what keeps them from being the best at what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you find something that will obviously make them significantly more money or save them a lot of time, then you have something to go on. Customers should really want to pay for it, almost have a burning desire to open their wallets. When they ask you if that is possible and you tell them it is, their mouth should drop to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Focus on what you can help them accomplish. Ask what customers want and which state they want to be in when the work is done. Don’t focus too much on the “how it’s done.” That is usually more based on tradition than on an optimized process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Time-Related Pains Most productivity-related issues cause temporal pain: people feel like they’re wasting time. These pains are caused by suboptimal processes and friction between tasks. If tedious work takes a lot of time, it keeps you from doing important and useful things instead. That leads to time mismanagement and relevant actions not being taken. By solving the time-related problem, productive tasks can be accomplished faster and sooner. When people complain about inefficiencies, tedium, or pointless work, you’re looking at a time-related problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs are good at coming up with ideas. We envision solutions to the problems that trouble the audience we have chosen to help.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A good question here is, &amp;ldquo;At what stage of your workflow will you be using this solution?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout your solution validation conversations, you want to project a clear interest in solving your customer&amp;rsquo;s problems without causing new ones. If you communicate this clearly in each call, you will create goal alignment between you and your prospect: you both want a great solution that makes things easier for the customer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Asking the Right Questions: Focus on Problems not Solutions When you talk to your customers or prospects, you will find that there are questions that always produce meaningful results: where they are now? Where do they want to be? What stands in the way of getting there? Essentially, this is applying the jobs-to-be-done framework to your communication strategy, trying to find their realistic and aspirational states, and then building a solution that allows them to go from one state to the other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What unites all niches is that they are inclusive of some and exclusive of others. The members of the in-group will be reasonably similar, depending on the specificity of the niche. That’s why niches work so well for bootstrapped businesses: if you can provide a tool that solves a niche problem very well, you can be sure that everyone in the niche will be interested in it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;She became an advocate for the needs of these teachers, and they followed her actively on social media, engaging in conversations, spreading the word, and, best of all, even defending the company and the product against people who dismissed or publicly disliked it. That’s the power of a tribe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you give people the opportunities to share your content and messages with other tribe members, they will. The interconnected nature of tribes facilitates this rapid exchange of information, and if you leverage those channels, your product will sell itself. At FeedbackPanda, it took one well-placed social media comment to start an avalanche of word-of-mouth referrals that lasted for years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Luckily, these influencers are also much cheaper to partner with than the prominent super-influencers. Often, they are not even aware of their influence, or they don’t necessarily see it as a monetizable activity. While I recommend you still offer them reasonable compensation, you can approach niche influencers as potential partners instead of just seeing them as a marketing channel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If your product is shareable, spend time on creating a referral system early in the life of your business. If it’s not shareable, defer this kind of system until you have exhausted better, more effective marketing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Look out for non-competitor competitive alternatives: the things people use instead of using an actual product. This can be Post-It notes, an Excel spreadsheet that does not involve numbers, anything that is a general tool applied to a specific problem. These types of makeshift solutions are where you can find your critical problems—and that is where you can best serve your niche.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Analyze your competitors for what they do well and what they don’t when you do your market research. If you’ve done your problem validation right, you will see gaps in the market that are not yet served. Build your products around those gaps, and look into partnering with your competitors to expand each other’s customer base.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like in machine learning, you run the risk of “overfitting” your niche; you might get too specific. There could be a few hundred “Star Trek fans that live in the New Orleans area and love to eat Quinoa,” but that won’t sustain a bootstrapped business.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A bootstrapped business works best when it starts out in a niche. Most companies will do really well by just staying there. Some expand into other markets. But that initial audience is one of the most important things to carefully select when you start a business.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A problem we experienced for ourselves. So we solved it for ourselves. We then saw that other teachers, just like Danielle, could benefit from our solution. They had the exact same problem. We knew our first version already solved the problem well. That’s why we knew other teachers would pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is the Audience Large Enough? Your audience will have to be big enough to sustain your business. It will likely also have to support competitors, as any successful business will attract competition.&lt;br&gt;
Is the Audience Small Enough? Contrary to popular belief, I think that for a bootstrapped company, in particular, some markets can be too big. Some audiences are too generic, some industries too vast for a great niche to exist. At least, in the beginning, you should have a clearly defined niche. As a bootstrapped entrepreneur, you will reach out to customers and be in direct contact.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Knowing if you need to focus more on sales or on marketing is very important. Some markets require you to reach out to buyers individually. For others, a good and well-targeted marketing strategy could mean you will never have to talk to a single customer before they subscribe or purchase. Being aware of how this will develop over time is essential in order to decide where to focus your attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Whenever a new kind of technology or process gets traction in a field that has not seen much change before, it will create little points of friction. Some of them will be critical. These will be the ones that warrant creating a SaaS business.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

If you see that significant forces are terraforming a market, creating an opportunity where there was none before, that is a good sign. Whenever a new kind of technology or process gets traction in a field that has not seen much change before, it will create little points of friction. Some of them will be critical. These will be the ones that warrant creating a SaaS business.</p>
<p>Some markets, where a lot of small deciders with their own budgets make decisions, are very lucrative. These people can be convinced without needing to deploy corporate diplomacy. You can show them a product, and they will try it out, as they have no one telling them not to. Small businesses and freelancers are great audiences for a bootstrapped SaaS, as they have budgets. Small budgets, maybe, but if there is a painful problem, there will be money to fix it.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Enterprise markets are hard to sell into for a small company, although it’s not impossible. Purchasing decisions take a long time, there are a lot of requirements even to be considered, and contracts tend to be custom and require a lot of work. Many enterprise customers won’t buy from small companies out of fear they will vanish within a few years, and that fear is not unfounded. In fact, even for your own bootstrapped business, I would recommend against using services offered by companies smaller than yourself. You will be better off looking for a market that is comprised of small to medium-sized businesses and self-employed freelancers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Monopoly markets with just a few big players will severely limit your options.&lt;br&gt;
Markets where years of ruthless competition have created a large number of bottom feeders are hazardous.&lt;br&gt;
充分竞争的市场也没戏,你打不过那些老家伙&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;usually are full of very similar competitors, fighting it out over price and marginal differences. This saturation makes it hard to enter a market, and even the businesses that are already in that market suffer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When markets shrink, that is often a sign of deterioration. Whenever the number of agents and purchasers in a market decreases, business growth stalls. People cut costs and unnecessary expenses get reduced. All businesses in that market will suffer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Identifying a Critical Problem: Working on the Right Thing Once you have found a suitable audience, you can start looking for problems. The great thing about niche markets is that the issues in them are specific and shared by the people in the niche. Solving a common problem will help a lot of people. You already have the right people. Now you just need the right problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You are looking for painful problems, and you want to solve the most painful of them all. You also need to validate that this is an actual problem that people need to have addressed. Sometimes, we just want to complain, but we don’t want to change our ways. You will need to find a problem so painful that we just have to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We found out that many other teachers did the same when they started talking about their self-built solutions in their online communities. Teachers began to share their templates through Google sheets. It was clear that this was a shared problem in a very tight-knit community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a sizeable market with an apparent, shared, and critical problem. The problem was solvable, but no one had yet built anything to make it noticeably easier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the Preparation Stage, the focus will be on finding an audience, their biggest problem, and a solution that solves that problem in a way to make people pay for it. You will find out how to price your product initially and start selling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tech founders—and I count myself as one—focus on products because that is what we use to solve our problems. After all, when you run into a challenging task, what do you look for first? An in-depth scientific explanation for the epistemological essence of the task? Or a tool that will do the job for you seconds after you install it?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many successful bootstrapped businesses start with an audience, a specific niche. They find their customers&amp;rsquo; critical problems and provide valuable solutions that people gladly pay for. Their product is centered around continuously providing value to new and existing customers. Audience, problem, solution, and product can be looked at individually.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Successful businesses are built by solving critical problems for an audience that will pay for a solution to their issues. The Preparation Stage is when you make these foundational choices. Once in motion, a business has certain inertia that makes these decisions hard to change. Even though pivoting your business into new markets is sometimes the right choice, it’s extra effort. That’s why it’s a good idea to spend considerable time on getting it right in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;评论引流最早可以追溯到博客时代，批量去别的网站下评论，网名和评论内容就是广告，去成百上千个网站评论，每天就能带来源源不断的流量。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;站长圈牛人卢松松，当年坚持在各个博客文章下评论，为后来的流量和名气提供了很大的助力。&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>评论引流最早可以追溯到博客时代，批量去别的网站下评论，网名和评论内容就是广告，去成百上千个网站评论，每天就能带来源源不断的流量。</p>
<p>站长圈牛人卢松松，当年坚持在各个博客文章下评论，为后来的流量和名气提供了很大的助力。</p>
<p>在自媒体时代，这套玩法同样有效，重点是简单，人人都能操作。</p>
<p>以最近几年流行的低价网课为例，注册 D 音号，将网名修改为业务名，网名和头像一定要诱惑，让人看了就想点击，提前关注几百个知识博主，只要对方有发布作品，第一时间去评论。</p>
<p>不要发广告，防止被删，评论内容直接套模板就行，给知识类博主留言，就用“get 到了”、“确实有用 感谢分享”、“不错 已收藏了”&hellip;</p>
<p>一个普通视频，保底播放量三五百，几十上百万播放量的爆款也很正常，你的网名和头像在无数次的曝光下，总会有一些人点开，发一些业务相关的视频，签名留下个人微信，每天就会有人加好友，转化率非常稳定。</p>
<p>小白的具体步骤如下：<br>
1.找个高转化率、刚需、市场广泛的细分行业。<br>
2.整理相关资料。<br>
3.注册 D 音，修改网名、头像，发几个业务相关的视频，签名引导加微信。<br>
4.关注 100+优质同行，无脑评论，多多益善。</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Any end goal will just lead to another goal, lead to another goal. We just play games in life. When you grow up, you’re playing the school game, or you’re playing the social game. Then you’re playing the money game, and then you’re playing the status game. These games just have longer and longer and longer-lived horizons. At some point, at least I believe, these are all just games. These are games where the outcome really stops mattering once you see through the game.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The punishment for the love of money is delivered at the same time as the money. As you make money, you just want even more, and you become paranoid and fearful of losing what you do have. There’s no free lunch.&lt;br&gt;
You make money to solve your money and material problems. I think the best way to stay away from this constant love of money is to not upgrade your lifestyle as you make money. It’s very easy to keep upgrading your lifestyle as you make money. But if you can hold your lifestyle fixed and hopefully make your money in giant lump sums as opposed to a trickle at a time, you won’t have time to upgrade your lifestyle. You may get so far ahead you actually become financially free.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You have to put in the time, but the judgment is more important. The direction you’re heading in matters more than how fast you move, especially with leverage. Picking the direction you’re heading in for every decision is far, far more important than how much force you apply. Just pick the right direction to start walking in, and start walking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>富豪，追求高品质，不好糊弄。<br>
中产，追求性价比，斤斤计较。<br>
蠢货，凭本能行事，容易糊弄。</p>
<p>本能包括：贪便宜、情绪化、害怕错过、爱占便宜&hellip;</p>
<p>直播带货，主要靠短视频导流。</p>
<p>什么样的短视频更吸引人？</p>
<p>破产清仓，流眼泪的中年人&hellip; 完美符合下等人的贪便宜 和 情绪化。</p>
<p>哥哥最近刷短视频，看到很多同类视频，套路都一样，生意做不下去了，倒闭了，亏本清仓甩卖。</p>
<p>相同套路的视频，反复发，把丝丝的智商按在地上摩擦。</p>
<p>通过短视频，给直播间导流，效果非常好。</p>
<p>如果直播比较熟练，还可以投流，投产比大于 1，就能放大操作，收益可观。</p>
<p>投产比持平，也不亏，至少赚个粉丝。<br>
投产比微亏，只要粉丝涨的多，依然不亏。</p>
<p>零成本搭建直播间，采用绿幕直播，找个图书批发素材，作为视频背景。</p>
<p>全程无任何技术含量，OBS+直播伴侣就能搞定。</p>
<p>直播间货源非常简单，直接从精选联盟找，零成本，零库存，赚佣金。</p>
<p>许多书都是白菜价，引流效果非常好。</p>
<p>1、卖家为了提高销量，让更多人帮忙卖货，会低价冲销量，这是常规操作。</p>
<p>2、进入产品页面，会发现不同价格的套餐，低价是引流款，高价是利润款，只要购买的人足够多，利润款足以覆盖引流款的损失，还能有盈余。</p>
<p>用脑残视频，吸引脑残进入直播间。<br>
通过投付费流量，提高直播间数据。<br>
用白菜价产品，吸引韭菜。<br>
用利润款产品，提高收益。</p>
<p>这么一个直播间，销量如何？</p>
<p>月销 5W 单+</p>
<p>整体操作框架就是这样，没什么技术含量。</p>
<p>一张背景图片，随便复制烂大街的鸡汤，几分钟就能搞一个视频。</p>
<p>这种辣鸡视频，都能播放量过万&hellip;.</p>
<p>唯一的缺陷是，97%是系统推流，一旦发其他领域的内容，播放量直接降到几百。</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The less you want something, the less you’re thinking about it, the less you’re obsessing over it, the more you’re going to do it in a natural way. The more you’re going to do it for yourself. You’re going to do it in a way you’re good at, and you’re going to stick with it. The people around you will see the quality of your work is higher.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If someone can train other people how to do something, then they can replace you. If they can replace you, then they don’t have to pay you a lot. You want to know how to do something other people don’t know how to do at the time period when those skills are in demand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Think about what product or service society wants but does not yet know how to get. You want to become the person who delivers it and delivers it at scale. That is really the challenge of how to make money. Now, the problem is becoming good at whatever “it” is. It moves around from generation to generation, but a lot of it happens to be in technology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most interesting and the most important form of leverage is the idea of products that have no marginal cost of replication. This is the new form of leverage. This was only invented in the last few hundred years. It started with the printing press. It accelerated with broadcast media, and now it’s really blown up with the internet and with coding. Now, you can multiply your efforts without involving other humans and without needing money from other humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>There are three broad classes of leverage</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One form of leverage is labor—other humans working for you. It is the oldest form of leverage, and actually not a great one in the modern world. [1] I would argue this is the worst form of leverage that you could possibly use. Managing other people is incredibly messy. It requires tremendous leadership skills. You’re one short hop from a mutiny or getting eaten or torn apart by the mob. [78] Money is good as a form of leverage. It means every time you make a decision, you multiply it with money. [1] Capital is a trickier form of leverage to use. It’s more modern. It’s the one that people have used to get fabulously wealthy in the last century. It’s probably been the dominant form of leverage in the last century. You can see this by looking for the richest people. It’s bankers, politicians in corrupt countries who print money, essentially people who move large amounts of money around. If you look at the top of very large companies, outside of technology companies, in many, many large old companies, the CEO job is really a financial job. It scales very, very well. If you get good at managing capital, you can manage more and more capital much more easily than you can manage more and more people. The final form of leverage is brand new—the most democratic form. It is: “products with no marginal cost of replication.” This includes books, media, movies, and code. Code is probably the most powerful form of permissionless leverage. All you need is a computer—you don’t need anyone’s permission.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The leverage for ordinary people</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Probably the most interesting thing to keep in mind about new forms of leverage is they are permissionless. They don’t require somebody else’s permission for you to use them or succeed. For labor leverage, somebody has to decide to follow you. For capital leverage, somebody has to give you money to invest or to turn into a product.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever you can in life, optimize for independence rather than pay. If you have independence and you’re accountable on your output, as opposed to your input—that’s the dream. &lt;br&gt;
A leveraged worker can out-produce a non-leveraged worker by a factor of one thousand or ten thousand. With a leveraged worker, judgment is far more important than how much time they put in or how hard they work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
