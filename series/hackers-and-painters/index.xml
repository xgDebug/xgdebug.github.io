      <description>&lt;p&gt;People in your niche will likely have the same problems. If they love fantasy football, they all need to keep track of their teams. If they enjoy fly-fishing, they all need to find information on where to fish and how the weather will impact their chances of a catch.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Luckily, these influencers are also much cheaper to partner with than the prominent super-influencers. Often, they are not even aware of their influence, or they don’t necessarily see it as a monetizable activity. While I recommend you still offer them reasonable compensation, you can approach niche influencers as potential partners instead of just seeing them as a marketing channel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Look out for non-competitor competitive alternatives: the things people use instead of using an actual product. This can be Post-It notes, an Excel spreadsheet that does not involve numbers, anything that is a general tool applied to a specific problem. These types of makeshift solutions are where you can find your critical problems—and that is where you can best serve your niche.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Analyze your competitors for what they do well and what they don’t when you do your market research. If you’ve done your problem validation right, you will see gaps in the market that are not yet served. Build your products around those gaps, and look into partnering with your competitors to expand each other’s customer base.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like in machine learning, you run the risk of “overfitting” your niche; you might get too specific. There could be a few hundred “Star Trek fans that live in the New Orleans area and love to eat Quinoa,” but that won’t sustain a bootstrapped business.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A bootstrapped business works best when it starts out in a niche. Most companies will do really well by just staying there. Some expand into other markets. But that initial audience is one of the most important things to carefully select when you start a business.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is the Audience Large Enough? Your audience will have to be big enough to sustain your business. It will likely also have to support competitors, as any successful business will attract competition.&lt;br&gt;
Is the Audience Small Enough? Contrary to popular belief, I think that for a bootstrapped company, in particular, some markets can be too big. Some audiences are too generic, some industries too vast for a great niche to exist. At least, in the beginning, you should have a clearly defined niche. As a bootstrapped entrepreneur, you will reach out to customers and be in direct contact.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Knowing if you need to focus more on sales or on marketing is very important. Some markets require you to reach out to buyers individually. For others, a good and well-targeted marketing strategy could mean you will never have to talk to a single customer before they subscribe or purchase. Being aware of how this will develop over time is essential in order to decide where to focus your attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What Are Good Markets for Bootstrapped SaaS? If you see that significant forces are terraforming a market, creating an opportunity where there was none before, that is a good sign. Whenever a new kind of technology or process gets traction in a field that has not seen much change before, it will create little points of friction. Some of them will be critical. These will be the ones that warrant creating a SaaS business.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Some markets, where a lot of small deciders with their own budgets make decisions, are very lucrative. These people can be convinced without needing to deploy corporate diplomacy. You can show them a product, and they will try it out, as they have no one telling them not to. Small businesses and freelancers are great audiences for a bootstrapped SaaS, as they have budgets. Small budgets, maybe, but if there is a painful problem, there will be money to fix it.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Enterprise markets are hard to sell into for a small company, although it’s not impossible. Purchasing decisions take a long time, there are a lot of requirements even to be considered, and contracts tend to be custom and require a lot of work. Many enterprise customers won’t buy from small companies out of fear they will vanish within a few years, and that fear is not unfounded. In fact, even for your own bootstrapped business, I would recommend against using services offered by companies smaller than yourself. You will be better off looking for a market that is comprised of small to medium-sized businesses and self-employed freelancers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Enterprise markets are hard to sell into for a small company, although it’s not impossible. Purchasing decisions take a long time, there are a lot of requirements even to be considered, and contracts tend to be custom and require a lot of work. Many enterprise customers won’t buy from small companies out of fear they will vanish within a few years, and that fear is not unfounded. In fact, even for your own bootstrapped business, I would recommend against using services offered by companies smaller than yourself. You will be better off looking for a market that is comprised of small to medium-sized businesses and self-employed freelancers.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Monopoly markets with just a few big players will severely limit your options.&lt;br&gt;
Markets where years of ruthless competition have created a large number of bottom feeders are hazardous.&lt;br&gt;
充分竞争的市场也没戏,你打不过那些老家伙&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;usually are full of very similar competitors, fighting it out over price and marginal differences. This saturation makes it hard to enter a market, and even the businesses that are already in that market suffer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When markets shrink, that is often a sign of deterioration. Whenever the number of agents and purchasers in a market decreases, business growth stalls. People cut costs and unnecessary expenses get reduced. All businesses in that market will suffer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Identifying a Critical Problem: Working on the Right Thing Once you have found a suitable audience, you can start looking for problems. The great thing about niche markets is that the issues in them are specific and shared by the people in the niche. Solving a common problem will help a lot of people. You already have the right people. Now you just need the right problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You are looking for painful problems, and you want to solve the most painful of them all. You also need to validate that this is an actual problem that people need to have addressed. Sometimes, we just want to complain, but we don’t want to change our ways. You will need to find a problem so painful that we just have to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;你做别人需要的东西或事情，然后得到报酬。有些人报酬较高，原因很简单，因为他们做得更好。大明星要比普通演员多赚许多钱，普通演员可能也有大明星的实力，但是人们在电影院选择看什么电影时总是被大明星吸引过去。当然，做出人们需要的东西并不是赚钱的唯一方法。抢银行、索贿、垄断市场也能搞到钱，并且是某些富豪最大的财富来源，但是这些手段不能代表财富的全部，更不是贫富分化的主要原因。每个人的技能不同，导致收入不同，这才是贫富分化的主要原因，正如逻辑学的“奥卡姆剃刀”原则所说，简单的解释就是最好的解释&lt;/p&gt;</description>
