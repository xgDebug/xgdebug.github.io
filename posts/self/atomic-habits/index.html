But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau—what I call the Plateau of Latent Potential.\nNote - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 316\nHa 好习惯难以养成,主要是没有进度条\nHighlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 317\nIf you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential.\nHighlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 320\nWhen you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success.\nHighlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 335\nAll big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit sprouts and grows stronger. Roots entrench themselves and branches grow. The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak within us.\nHighlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 341\nFORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD\nNote - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 341\n忽略目标,专注于打造系统\nHighlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 345\nI began to realize that my results had very little to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I followed.\nNote - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 346\n系统比目标有用\nHighlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 347\nGoals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. If you’re a coach, your goal might be to win a championship. Your system is the way you recruit players, manage your assistant coaches, and conduct practice. If you’re an entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a million-dollar business. Your system is how you test product ideas, hire employees, and run marketing campaigns. If you’re a musician, your goal might be to play a new piece. Your system is how often you practice, how you break down and tackle difficult measures, and your method for receiving feedback from your instructor.\nNote - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 352\n目标是想要获得的东西,系统是如何获得的方法论\nHighlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 353\nNow for the interesting question: If you completely ignored your goals and focused only on your system, would you still succeed? For example, if you were a basketball coach and you ignored your goal to win a championship and focused only on what your team does at practice each day, would you still get results?\nNote - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 355\n不要设定目标为年级第几,而是设定为爱学习\nHighlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 360\nProblem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.\nHighlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 361\nGoal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias.\nNote - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 361\n亚军的目标也是冠军,这就是幸存者偏差\nHighlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 368\nProblem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.\nHighlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 368\nImagine you have a messy room and you set a goal to clean it. If you summon the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room—for now. But if you maintain the same sloppy, pack-rat habits that led to a messy room in the first place, soon you’ll be looking at a new pile of clutter and hoping for another burst of motivation. You’re left chasing the same outcome because you never changed the system behind it. You treated a symptom without addressing the cause.\nNote - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 371\n整理房间是一个目标,爱整洁才是身份\nHighlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 373\nWhen you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.\nHighlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 375\nProblem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.\nNote - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 376\n达不成目标还怎么快乐\nHighlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 376\nThe implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal, then I’ll be happy.” The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone.\nHighlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 383\nA systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.\nHighlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 385\nProblem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.\nNote - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 385\n溜溜球效应\nHighlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 386\nFinally, a goal-oriented mind-set can create a “yo-yo” effect. Many runners work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line, they stop training. The race is no longer there to motivate them. When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal.\nHighlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 389\nThe purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.\nHighlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 395\nFocusing on the overall system, rather than a single goal, is one of the core themes of this book.\nHighlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits \u003e Location 403\nHabits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run. Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential. Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient. An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 414\nIt often feels difficult to keep good habits going for more than a few days, even with sincere effort and the occasional burst of motivation. Habits like exercise, meditation, journaling, and cooking are reasonable for a day or two and then become a hassle. However, once your habits are established, they seem to stick around forever—especially the unwanted ones.\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 418\nChanging our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way.\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 422\nTHREE LAYERS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 425\nThe first layer is changing your outcomes. This level is concerned with changing your results: losing weight, publishing a book, winning a championship. Most of the goals you set are associated with this level of change. The second layer is changing your process. This level is concerned with changing your habits and systems: implementing a new routine at the gym, decluttering your desk for better workflow, developing a meditation practice. Most of the habits you build are associated with this level. The third and deepest layer is changing your identity. This level is concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your judgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level.\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 431\nOutcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 434\nMany people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.\nNote - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 436\n目标不是单一成就,而是成为什么人\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 441\nImagine two people resisting a cigarette. When offered a smoke, the first person says, “No thanks. I’m trying to quit.” It sounds like a reasonable response, but this person still believes they are a smoker who is trying to be something else. They are hoping their behavior will change while carrying around the same beliefs. The second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m not a smoker.” It’s a small difference, but this statement signals a shift in identity.\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 446\nMost people don’t even consider identity change when they set out to improve. They just think, “I want to be skinny (outcome) and if I stick to this diet, then I’ll be skinny (process).” They set goals and determine the actions they should take to achieve those goals without considering the beliefs that drive their actions. They never shift the way they look at themselves, and they don’t realize that their old identity can sabotage their new plans for change.\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 454\nBehavior that is incongruent with the self will not last.\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 457\nIt’s hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior. You have a new goal and a new plan, but you haven’t changed who you are.\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 466\nThe ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this.\nNote - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 468\n好标签\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 472\nTrue behavior change is identity change.\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 475\nThe goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader. The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner. The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.\nNote - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 477\n身份认同决定行为\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 477\nYour behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity.\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 482\nDoing the right thing is easy. After all, when your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be.\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 496\nOn any given day, you may struggle with your habits because you’re too busy or too tired or too overwhelmed or hundreds of other reasons. Over the long run, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self-image gets in the way. This is why you can’t get too attached to one version of your identity. Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.\nNote - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 499\n抛弃旧版本的你,不断迭代\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 502\nTHE TWO-STEP PROCESS TO CHANGING YOUR IDENTITY\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 503\nYour identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset beliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and conditioned through experience.*\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 505\nMore precisely, your habits are how you embody your identity. When you make your bed each day, you embody the identity of an organized person. When you write each day, you embody the identity of a creative person. When you train each day, you embody the identity of an athletic person.\nNote - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 506\n以身作则的意思是,孩子也想成为和你一样的人(爱学习?可以无限玩手机?)\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 516\nOf course, your habits are not the only actions that influence your identity, but by virtue of their frequency they are usually the most important ones. Each experience in life modifies your self-image, but it’s unlikely you would consider yourself a soccer player because you kicked a ball once or an artist because you scribbled a picture. As you repeat these actions, however, the evidence accumulates and your self-image begins to change. The effect of one-off experiences tends to fade away while the effect of habits gets reinforced with time, which means your habits contribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity. In this way, the process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself.\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 527\nSmall habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That’s the paradox of making small improvements. Putting this all together, you can see that habits are the path to changing your identity. The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do. Each time you write a page, you are a writer. Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician. Each time you start a workout, you are an athlete. Each time you encourage your employees, you are a leader.\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 532\nEach habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far more important: to trust yourself. You start to believe you can actually accomplish these things.\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 537\nNew identities require new evidence. If you keep casting the same votes you’ve always cast, you’re going to get the same results you’ve always had. If nothing changes, nothing is going to change. It is a simple two-step process: Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins.\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 545\n“Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?” Who is the type of person that could lose forty pounds? Who is the type of person that could learn a new language? Who is the type of person that could run a successful start-up?\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 548\nThis process can lead to beliefs like: “I’m the kind of teacher who stands up for her students.” “I’m the kind of doctor who gives each patient the time and empathy they need.” “I’m the kind of manager who advocates for her employees.”\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 551\nOnce you have a handle on the type of person you want to be, you can begin taking small steps to reinforce your desired identity. I have a friend who lost over 100 pounds by asking herself, “What would a healthy person do?” All day long, she would use this question as a guide. Would a healthy person walk or take a cab? Would a healthy person order a burrito or a salad? She figured if she acted like a healthy person long enough, eventually she would become that person. She was right.\nNote - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 555\nFake it ,untill you make it\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 558\nTHE REAL REASON HABITS MATTER Identity change is the North Star of habit change.\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 561\nyou becoming the type of person you want to become?” The first step is not what or how, but who. You need to know who you want to be. Otherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a rudder. And that’s why we are starting here.\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 568\nUltimately, your habits matter because they help you become the type of person you wish to be. They are the channel through which you develop your deepest beliefs about yourself. Quite literally, you become your habits.\nHighlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) \u003e Location 571\nThere are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change. The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become. Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.\nHighlight(yellow) - 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps \u003e Location 616\nHabits are mental shortcuts learned from experience.\nHighlight(yellow) - 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps \u003e Location 622\nHabits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.\nHighlight(yellow) - 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps \u003e Location 634\nTHE SCIENCE OF HOW HABITS WORK The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.*\nHighlight(yellow) - 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps \u003e Location 638\nAll habits proceed through four stages in the same order: cue, craving, response, and reward.\nHighlight(yellow) - 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps \u003e Location 645\nthe cue is the first indication that we’re close to a reward, it naturally leads to a craving. Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every habit.\nHighlight(yellow) - 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps \u003e Location 654\nThe third step is the response.\nHighlight(yellow) - 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps \u003e Location 660\nThe first purpose of rewards is to satisfy your craving. Yes, rewards provide benefits on their own. Food and water deliver the energy you need to survive.\nHighlight(yellow) - 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps \u003e Location 664\nSecond, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future. Your brain is a reward detector. As you go about your life, your sensory nervous system is continuously monitoring which actions satisfy your desires and deliver pleasure.\nHighlight(yellow) - 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps \u003e Location 673\nThe four stages of habit are best described as a feedback loop. They form an endless cycle that is running every moment you are alive. This “habit loop” is continually scanning the environment, predicting what will happen next, trying out different responses, and learning from the results.*\nHighlight(yellow) - 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps \u003e Location 676\nIn summary, the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue.\nHighlight(yellow) - 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps \u003e Location 689\nAll behavior is driven by the desire to solve a problem.\nHighlight(yellow) - 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps \u003e Location 738\nHow to Create a Good Habit The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious.

How can I make it attractive? How can I make it easy? How can I make it satisfying?\nHighlight(yellow) - 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps \u003e Location 757\nEvery goal is doomed to fail if it goes against the grain of human nature.\nHighlight(yellow) - 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps \u003e Location 760\nChapter Summary A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic. The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible. Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward. The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.\nTHE 1ST LAW: Make It Obvious\nHighlight(yellow) - 4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right \u003e Location 791\nWith enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. Automatically, your brain encodes the lessons learned through experience. We can’t always explain what it is we are learning, but learning is happening all along the way, and your ability to notice the relevant cues in a given situation is the foundation for every habit you have.\nHighlight(yellow) - 4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right \u003e Location 800\nThis is one of the most surprising insights about our habits: you don’t need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice an opportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to it. This is what makes habits useful.\nHighlight(yellow) - 4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right \u003e Location 817\n“Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.”\nHighlight(yellow) - 4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right \u003e Location 828\nPointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level.\nHighlight(yellow) - 4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right \u003e Location 833\nThe more automatic a behavior becomes, the less likely we are to consciously think about it. And when we’ve done something a thousand times before, we begin to overlook things. We assume that the next time will be just like the last.\nHighlight(yellow) - 4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right \u003e Location 836\nOne of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining awareness of what we are actually doing.\nHighlight(yellow) - 4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right \u003e Location 873\nWith enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing. The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them. Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions. The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.\nHighlight(yellow) - 5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit \u003e Location 888\nI will partake in at least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on [DAY] at [TIME] in [PLACE].”\nHighlight(yellow) - 5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit \u003e Location 904\nToo many people try to change their habits without these basic details figured out. We tell ourselves, “I’m going to eat healthier” or “I’m going to write more,” but we never say when and where these habits are going to happen.\nHighlight(yellow) - 5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit \u003e Location 908\nMany people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity.\nHighlight(yellow) - 5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit \u003e Location 912\nSimply follow your predetermined plan. The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this sentence: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. Meditation. I will meditate for one minute at 7 a.m. in my kitchen. Studying. I will study Spanish for twenty minutes at 6 p.m. in my bedroom. Exercise. I will exercise for one hour at 5 p.m. in my local gym. Marriage. I will make my partner a cup of tea at 8 a.m. in the kitchen.\nHighlight(yellow) - 5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit \u003e Location 927\nHABIT STACKING: A SIMPLE PLAN TO OVERHAUL YOUR HABITS\nHighlight(yellow) - 5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit \u003e Location 940\nThe Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.\nNote - 5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit \u003e Location 941\n迪德罗效应\nHighlight(yellow) - 5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit \u003e Location 946\nEach action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior.\nHighlight(yellow) - 5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit \u003e Location 948\nOne of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.\nHighlight(yellow) - 5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit \u003e Location 953\n“After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”\nHighlight(yellow) - 5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit \u003e Location 958\nThe key is to tie your desired behavior into something you already do each day.\nHighlight(yellow) - 5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit \u003e Location 1011\nThe 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it obvious. The two most common cues are time and location. Creating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location. The implementation intention formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]. Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit. The habit stacking formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].\nHighlight(yellow) - 6: Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More \u003e Location 1036\nEnvironment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior.\nHighlight(yellow) - 6: Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More \u003e Location 1089\nIf you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment. The most persistent behaviors usually have multiple cues.\nHighlight(yellow) - 6: Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More \u003e Location 1113\nhabits can be easier to change in a new environment.\nHighlight(yellow) - 6: Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More \u003e Location 1143\nChapter Summary Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over time. Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out. Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment. Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue. It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.\nHighlight(pink) - 7: The Secret to Self-Control \u003e Location 1182\nShaming obese people with weight-loss presentations can make them feel stressed, and as a result many people return to their favorite coping strategy: overeating. Showing pictures of blackened lungs to smokers leads to higher levels of anxiety, which drives many people to reach for a cigarette. If you’re not careful about cues, you can cause the very behavior you want to stop.\nHighlight(blue) - 7: The Secret to Self-Control \u003e Location 1185\nBad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster the feelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because you eat junk food, you feel bad.\nHighlight(yellow) - 7: The Secret to Self-Control \u003e Location 1199\nIf you can’t seem to get any work done, leave your phone in another room for a few hours. If you’re continually feeling like you’re not enough, stop following social media accounts that trigger jealousy and envy. If you’re wasting too much time watching television, move the TV out of the bedroom. If you’re spending too much money on electronics, quit reading reviews of the latest tech gear. If you’re playing too many video games, unplug the console and put it in a closet after each use.\nNote - 7: The Secret to Self-Control \u003e Location 1203\n移除敏感源\nHighlight(yellow) - 7: The Secret to Self-Control \u003e Location 1209\nChapter Summary The inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it invisible. Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten. People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it. One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it. Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.\nTHE 2ND LAW: Make It Attractive\nHighlight(yellow) - 8: How to Make a Habit Irresistible \u003e Location 1236\nHow to Make a Habit Irresistible\nHighlight(yellow) - 8: How to Make a Habit Irresistible \u003e Location 1276\nMake it attractive. The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.\nHighlight(yellow) - 8: How to Make a Habit Irresistible \u003e Location 1287\nIf you want to increase the odds that a behavior will occur, then you need to make it attractive. Throughout our discussion of the 2nd Law, our goal is to learn how to make our habits irresistible.\nHighlight(yellow) - 8: How to Make a Habit Irresistible \u003e Location 1315\nAs an adult, daydreaming about an upcoming vacation can be more enjoyable than actually being on vacation.\nHighlight(pink) - 8: How to Make a Habit Irresistible \u003e Location 1358\npsychology theory known as Premack’s Principle. Named after the work of professor David Premack, the principle states that “more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.” In other words, even if you don’t really want to process overdue work emails, you’ll become conditioned to do it if it means you get to do something you really want to do along the way. You can even combine temptation bundling with the habit stacking strategy we discussed in Chapter 5 to create a set of rules to guide your behavior.\nHighlight(pink) - 8: How to Make a Habit Irresistible \u003e Location 1362\nThe habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED]. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].\nHighlight(pink) - 8: How to Make a Habit Irresistible \u003e Location 1371\nIf you want to check Facebook, but you need to exercise more: After I pull out my phone, I will do ten burpees (need). After I do ten burpees, I will check Facebook (want).\nHighlight(pink) - 8: How to Make a Habit Irresistible \u003e Location 1378\nChapter Summary The 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it attractive. The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming. Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act. It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike. Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.\nHighlight(pink) - 9: The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits \u003e Location 1414\none of the deepest human desires is to belong. And this ancient preference exerts a powerful influence on our modern behavior.\nNote - 9: The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits \u003e Location 1415\n利用归属感可以做很多事情，比如社群，宗教，Niche，小团体。 这也是做产品的方向\nHighlight(orange) - 9: The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits \u003e Location 1421\nMost of the time, going along with the group does not feel like a burden. Everyone wants to belong. If you grow up in a family that rewards you for your chess skills, playing chess will seem like a very attractive thing to do. If you work in a job where everyone wears expensive suits, then you’ll be inclined to splurge on one as well. If all of your friends are sharing an inside joke or using a new phrase, you’ll want to do it, too, so they know that you “get it.” Behaviors are attractive when they help us fit in.\nHighlight(orange) - 9: The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits \u003e Location 1425\nWe imitate the habits of three groups in particular: The close.

We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe. We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige). One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group. The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves. If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.\nBookmark - 10: How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits \u003e Location 1518\nHighlight(yellow) - 10: How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits \u003e Location 1526\n“It always starts with your friends.

However, you can associate it with freedom rather than limitation if you realize one simple truth: living below your current means increases your future means. The money you save this month increases your purchasing power next month.\nHighlight(yellow) - 10: How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits \u003e Location 1633\nChapter Summary The inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it unattractive. Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper underlying motive. Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them. The prediction leads to a feeling. Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive. Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings. Create a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.\nTHE 3RD LAW: Make It Easy\nHighlight(yellow) - 11: Walk Slowly, but Never Backward \u003e Location 1666\nWalk Slowly, but Never Backward\nHighlight(yellow) - 11: Walk Slowly, but Never Backward \u003e Location 1677\nIt is easy to get bogged down trying to find the optimal plan for change: the fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea for a side hustle. We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we never get around to taking action. As Voltaire once wrote, “The best is the enemy of the good.”\nNote - 11: Walk Slowly, but Never Backward \u003e Location 1680\n最好是好的敌人,想要最好就不会行动\nHighlight(yellow) - 11: Walk Slowly, but Never Backward \u003e Location 1684\nSometimes motion is useful, but it will never produce an outcome by itself. It doesn’t matter how many times you go talk to the personal trainer, that motion will never get you in shape. Only the action of working out will get the result you’re looking to achieve.\nHighlight(yellow) - 11: Walk Slowly, but Never Backward \u003e Location 1693\nMotion makes you feel like you’re getting things done. But really, you’re just preparing to get something done. When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something. You don’t want to merely be planning.

The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning. Focus on taking action, not being in motion. Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition. The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it.\nHighlight(yellow) - 12: The Law of Least Effort \u003e Location 1851\nWhen you wake up, making breakfast will be easy. Want to draw more? Put your pencils, pens, notebooks, and drawing tools on top of your desk, within easy reach. Want to exercise? Set out your workout clothes, shoes, gym bag, and water bottle ahead of time. Want to improve your diet? Chop up a ton of fruits and vegetables on weekends and pack them in containers, so you have easy access to healthy, ready-to-eat options during the week.\nHighlight(yellow) - 12: The Law of Least Effort \u003e Location 1872\nChapter Summary Human behavior follows the Law of Least Effort. We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work. Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible. Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors. When friction is low, habits are easy. Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult. Prime your environment to make future actions easier.\nHighlight(orange) - 13: How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule \u003e Location 1918\n“When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” You’ll find that nearly any habit can be scaled down into a two-minute version: “Read before bed each night” becomes “Read one page.” “Do thirty minutes of yoga” becomes “Take out my yoga mat.” “Study for class” becomes “Open my notes.” “Fold the laundry” becomes “Fold one pair of socks.” “Run three miles” becomes “Tie my running shoes.”\nNote - 13: How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule \u003e Location 1922\n培养从两分钟小习惯开始\nHighlight(yellow) - 13: How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule \u003e Location 1922\nThe idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start.\nNote - 13: How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule \u003e Location 1923\n新的习惯越简单越好,它很容易完成\nHighlight(yellow) - 13: How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule \u003e Location 1924\nthis is a powerful strategy because once you’ve started doing the right thing, it is much easier to continue doing it.\nHighlight(yellow) - 13: How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule \u003e Location 1924\nA new habit should not feel like a challenge.\nNote - 13: How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule \u003e Location 1925\n行的习惯不应该是挑战\nHighlight(yellow) - 13: How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule \u003e Location 1943\nPeople often think it’s weird to get hyped about reading one page or meditating for one minute or making one sales call. But the point is not to do one thing. The point is to master the habit of showing up. The truth is, a habit must be established before it can be improved.\nNote - 13: How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule \u003e Location 1945\n微小习惯最容易形成,并且会长大\nHighlight(orange) - 13: How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule \u003e Location 1998\nChapter Summary Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behavior for minutes or hours afterward. Many habits occur at decisive moments—choices that are like a fork in the road—and either send you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one. The Two-Minute Rule states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things. Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist.\nHighlight(blue) - 14: How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible \u003e Location 2061\nUnsubscribe from emails.

Typically, they involve putting technology to work for you. Technology can transform actions that were once hard, annoying, and complicated into behaviors that are easy, painless, and simple. It is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behavior.\nNote - 14: How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible \u003e Location 2073\n通过自动化手段来消除坏习惯，比如取消游戏订阅\nHighlight(pink) - 14: How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible \u003e Location 2076\nMedicine: Prescriptions can be automatically refilled.

A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future. The ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to automate your habits. Onetime choices—like buying a better mattress or enrolling in an automatic savings plan—are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time. Using technology to automate your habits is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behavior.\nTHE 4TH LAW: Make It Satisfying\nHighlight(pink) - 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change \u003e Location 2143\nThe Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change\nHighlight(pink) - 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change \u003e Location 2173\nWe are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. This is entirely logical. Feelings of pleasure—even minor ones like washing your hands with soap that smells nice and lathers well—are signals that tell the brain: “This feels good. Do this again, next time.” Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth remembering and repeating.\nNote - 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change \u003e Location 2176\n赋予行为意义：打水不是麻烦而是锻炼？ 锻炼不是累而是享受生活？\nHighlight(pink) - 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change \u003e Location 2191\nThe first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time.

The road less traveled is the road of delayed gratification. If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll face less competition and often get a bigger payoff. As the saying goes, the last mile is always the least crowded.\nNote - 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change \u003e Location 2238\n少有人走的路不会拥挤，延迟满足往往有最大的回报\nHighlight(orange) - 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change \u003e Location 2243\nHere’s the problem: most people know that delaying gratification is the wise approach. They want the benefits of good habits: to be healthy, productive, at peace. But these outcomes are seldom top-of-mind at the decisive moment. Thankfully, it’s possible to train yourself to delay gratification—but you need to work with the grain of human nature, not against it. The best way to do this is to add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run and a little bit of immediate pain to ones that don’t.\nNote - 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change \u003e Location 2246\n人性就是立刻满足，我们不能与人性作对，所以需要一点技巧\nHighlight(orange) - 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change \u003e Location 2261\nOne solution is to turn the situation on its head. You want to make avoidance visible. Open a savings account and label it for something you want—maybe “Leather Jacket.” Whenever you pass on a purchase, put the same amount of money in the account. Skip your morning latte? Transfer $5.\nNote - 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change \u003e Location 2263\n开一个梦想账户，当你想买东西时，直接转入替代账户。\nHighlight(blue) - 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change \u003e Location 2266\nOne of my readers and his wife used a similar setup.

They labeled their savings account “Trip to Europe.” Whenever they skipped going out to eat, they transferred $50 into the account. At the end of the year, they put the money toward the vacation.\nHighlight(blue) - 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change \u003e Location 2275\nYou do it because it’s who you are and it feels good to be you. The more a habit becomes part of your life, the less you need outside encouragement to follow through. Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit.\nHighlight(blue) - 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change \u003e Location 2281\nChapter Summary The 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it satisfying. We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards. The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided. To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful—even if it’s in a small way. The first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change—make it satisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time.\nHighlight(blue) - 16: How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day \u003e Location 2301\nMaking progress is satisfying, and visual measures—like moving paper clips or hairpins or marbles—provide clear evidence of your progress. As a result, they reinforce your behavior and add a little bit of immediate satisfaction to any activity. Visual measurement comes in many forms: food journals, workout logs, loyalty punch cards, the progress bar on a software download, even the page numbers in a book. But perhaps the best way to measure your progress is with a habit tracker.\nHighlight(blue) - 16: How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day \u003e Location 2412\nChapter Summary One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress. A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit—like marking an X on a calendar. Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress. Don’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive. Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible. Just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing.\nNote - 16: How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day \u003e Location 2417\nKindle 的连续读书多少天何尝不是一种习惯进度条呢？\nHighlight(yellow) - 17: How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything \u003e Location 2493\nChapter Summary The inversion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it unsatisfying. We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or unsatisfying. An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion of us. A habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any behavior. It makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful. Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful motivator.\nNote - 17: How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything \u003e Location 2498\n对坏习惯进行监督与惩罚\nADVANCED TACTICS: How to Go from Being Merely Good to Being Truly Great\nHighlight(blue) - 18: The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don’t) \u003e Location 2686\nChapter Summary The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition. Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle. Genes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances. Habits are easier when they align with your natural abilities. Choose the habits that best suit you. Play a game that favors your strengths. If you can’t find a game that favors you, create one. Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on.\nNote - 18: The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don’t) \u003e Location 2692\n选者你适合的领域\nHighlight(blue) - 19: The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work \u003e Location 2717\nThe human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty. If you love tennis and try to play a serious match against a four-year-old, you will quickly become bored. It’s too easy. You’ll win every point. In contrast, if you play a professional tennis player like Roger Federer or Serena Williams, you will quickly lose motivation because the match is too difficult.\nNote - 19: The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work \u003e Location 2720\n人喜欢挑战，但是没有胜率或者没有互动的挑战无法坚持\nHighlight(blue) - 19: The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work \u003e Location 2723\nThe Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities.

You have to fall in love with boredom.\nNote - 19: The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work \u003e Location 2791\n如果你无法让它变的有趣，那你就必须爱上无聊\nHighlight(blue) - 19: The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work \u003e Location 2791\nChapter Summary The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. As habits become routine, they become less interesting and less satisfying. We get bored. Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s the ability to keep going when work isn’t exciting that makes the difference. Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.\nNote - 19: The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work \u003e Location 2796\n成功的敌人不是失败，而是无趣与无聊，所以我们必须让它有趣。 做产品也是一样，必须一开始就有人用，有互动，有反馈，否则你坚持不下去的。一定要从一开始就有种子用户，开发中的时候就有一个群的人在期待。\nHighlight(blue) - 20: The Downside of Creating Good Habits \u003e Location 2938\nChapter Summary The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors. Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious of your performance over time. The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it.\nHighlight(blue) - Conclusion: The Secret to Results That Last \u003e Location 2982\nThat’s the power of atomic habits.

The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little difference on any given day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits > Location 313</p><p>。人们做了一些小的改变，没有看到切实的结果，并决定停止。你会想，“我已经连续一个月每天都跑步了，为什么我的身体没有任何变化？一旦这种想法占据了上风，就很容易让好习惯被抛在一边。但为了产生有意义的改变，习惯需要持续足够长的时间才能突破这个高原——我称之为潜在潜力高原。 People make a few small changes, fail to see a tangible result, and decide to stop. You think, “I’ve been running every day for a month, so why can’t I see any change in my body?” Once this kind of thinking takes over, it’s easy to let good habits fall by the wayside. But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau—what I call the Plateau of Latent Potential.</p><p>Note - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits > Location 316</p><p>Ha 好习惯难以养成,主要是没有进度条</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits > Location 317</p><p>If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits > Location 320</p><p>When you finally break through the Plateau of Latent Potential, people will call it an overnight success.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits > Location 335</p><p>All big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision. But as that decision is repeated, a habit sprouts and grows stronger. Roots entrench themselves and branches grow. The task of breaking a bad habit is like uprooting a powerful oak within us.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits > Location 341</p><p>FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD</p><p>Note - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits > Location 341</p><p>忽略目标,专注于打造系统</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits > Location 345</p><p>I began to realize that my results had very little to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I followed.</p><p>Note - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits > Location 346</p><p>系统比目标有用</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits > Location 347</p><p>Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. If you’re a coach, your goal might be to win a championship. Your system is the way you recruit players, manage your assistant coaches, and conduct practice. If you’re an entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a million-dollar business. Your system is how you test product ideas, hire employees, and run marketing campaigns. If you’re a musician, your goal might be to play a new piece. Your system is how often you practice, how you break down and tackle difficult measures, and your method for receiving feedback from your instructor.</p><p>Note - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits > Location 352</p><p>目标是想要获得的东西,系统是如何获得的方法论</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits > Location 353</p><p>Now for the interesting question: If you completely ignored your goals and focused only on your system, would you still succeed?

If you summon the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room—for now. But if you maintain the same sloppy, pack-rat habits that led to a messy room in the first place, soon you’ll be looking at a new pile of clutter and hoping for another burst of motivation. You’re left chasing the same outcome because you never changed the system behind it. You treated a symptom without addressing the cause.</p><p>Note - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits > Location 371</p><p>整理房间是一个目标,爱整洁才是身份</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits > Location 373</p><p>When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level.

When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits > Location 385</p><p>Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.</p><p>Note - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits > Location 385</p><p>溜溜球效应</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits > Location 386</p><p>Finally, a goal-oriented mind-set can create a “yo-yo” effect. Many runners work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line, they stop training. The race is no longer there to motivate them. When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits > Location 389</p><p>The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits > Location 395</p><p>Focusing on the overall system, rather than a single goal, is one of the core themes of this book.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 1: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits > Location 403</p><p>Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run. Habits are a double-edged sword. They can work for you or against you, which is why understanding the details is essential. Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold. The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient. An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) > Location 414</p><p>It often feels difficult to keep good habits going for more than a few days, even with sincere effort and the occasional burst of motivation. Habits like exercise, meditation, journaling, and cooking are reasonable for a day or two and then become a hassle. However, once your habits are established, they seem to stick around forever—especially the unwanted ones.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) > Location 418</p><p>Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) > Location 422</p><p>THREE LAYERS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) > Location 425</p><p>The first layer is changing your outcomes. This level is concerned with changing your results: losing weight, publishing a book, winning a championship. Most of the goals you set are associated with this level of change. The second layer is changing your process. This level is concerned with changing your habits and systems: implementing a new routine at the gym, decluttering your desk for better workflow, developing a meditation practice. Most of the habits you build are associated with this level. The third and deepest layer is changing your identity. This level is concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your judgments about yourself and others. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are associated with this level.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) > Location 431</p><p>Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) > Location 434</p><p>Many people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.</p><p>Note - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) > Location 436</p><p>目标不是单一成就,而是成为什么人</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) > Location 441</p><p>Imagine two people resisting a cigarette. When offered a smoke, the first person says, “No thanks. I’m trying to quit.” It sounds like a reasonable response, but this person still believes they are a smoker who is trying to be something else. They are hoping their behavior will change while carrying around the same beliefs. The second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m not a smoker.” It’s a small difference, but this statement signals a shift in identity.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) > Location 446</p><p>Most people don’t even consider identity change when they set out to improve. They just think, “I want to be skinny (outcome) and if I stick to this diet, then I’ll be skinny (process).” They set goals and determine the actions they should take to achieve those goals without considering the beliefs that drive their actions. They never shift the way they look at themselves, and they don’t realize that their old identity can sabotage their new plans for change.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) > Location 454</p><p>Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) > Location 457</p><p>It’s hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior.

Over the long run, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self-image gets in the way. This is why you can’t get too attached to one version of your identity. Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.</p><p>Note - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) > Location 499</p><p>抛弃旧版本的你,不断迭代</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) > Location 502</p><p>THE TWO-STEP PROCESS TO CHANGING YOUR IDENTITY</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) > Location 503</p><p>Your identity emerges out of your habits.

Each experience in life modifies your self-image, but it’s unlikely you would consider yourself a soccer player because you kicked a ball once or an artist because you scribbled a picture. As you repeat these actions, however, the evidence accumulates and your self-image begins to change. The effect of one-off experiences tends to fade away while the effect of habits gets reinforced with time, which means your habits contribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity. In this way, the process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) > Location 527</p><p>Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That’s the paradox of making small improvements. Putting this all together, you can see that habits are the path to changing your identity. The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do. Each time you write a page, you are a writer. Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician. Each time you start a workout, you are an athlete. Each time you encourage your employees, you are a leader.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) > Location 532</p><p>Each habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far more important: to trust yourself. You start to believe you can actually accomplish these things.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) > Location 537</p><p>New identities require new evidence. If you keep casting the same votes you’ve always cast, you’re going to get the same results you’ve always had. If nothing changes, nothing is going to change. It is a simple two-step process: Decide the type of person you want to be. Prove it to yourself with small wins.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa) > Location 545</p><p>“Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?” Who is the type of person that could lose forty pounds?

Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps > Location 616</p><p>Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps > Location 622</p><p>Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps > Location 634</p><p>THE SCIENCE OF HOW HABITS WORK The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.*</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps > Location 638</p><p>All habits proceed through four stages in the same order: cue, craving, response, and reward.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps > Location 645</p><p>the cue is the first indication that we’re close to a reward, it naturally leads to a craving.

The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible. Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward. The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.</p><p>THE 1ST LAW: Make It Obvious</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right > Location 791</p><p>With enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. Automatically, your brain encodes the lessons learned through experience. We can’t always explain what it is we are learning, but learning is happening all along the way, and your ability to notice the relevant cues in a given situation is the foundation for every habit you have.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right > Location 800</p><p>This is one of the most surprising insights about our habits: you don’t need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice an opportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to it. This is what makes habits useful.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right > Location 817</p><p>“Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.”</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right > Location 828</p><p>Pointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right > Location 833</p><p>The more automatic a behavior becomes, the less likely we are to consciously think about it. And when we’ve done something a thousand times before, we begin to overlook things. We assume that the next time will be just like the last.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right > Location 836</p><p>One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining awareness of what we are actually doing.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right > Location 873</p><p>With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing. The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them. Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions. The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit > Location 888</p><p>I will partake in at least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on [DAY] at [TIME] in [PLACE].”</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit > Location 904</p><p>Too many people try to change their habits without these basic details figured out.

Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue.

The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming. Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act. It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike. Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.</p><p>Highlight(pink) - 9: The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits > Location 1414</p><p>one of the deepest human desires is to belong.

We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige). One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group. The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves. If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.</p><p>Bookmark - 10: How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits > Location 1518</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 10: How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits > Location 1526</p><p>“It always starts with your friends.

They want the benefits of good habits: to be healthy, productive, at peace. But these outcomes are seldom top-of-mind at the decisive moment. Thankfully, it’s possible to train yourself to delay gratification—but you need to work with the grain of human nature, not against it. The best way to do this is to add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run and a little bit of immediate pain to ones that don’t.</p><p>Note - 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change > Location 2246</p><p>人性就是立刻满足，我们不能与人性作对，所以需要一点技巧</p><p>Highlight(orange) - 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change > Location 2261</p><p>One solution is to turn the situation on its head. You want to make avoidance visible. Open a savings account and label it for something you want—maybe “Leather Jacket.” Whenever you pass on a purchase, put the same amount of money in the account. Skip your morning latte? Transfer $5.</p><p>Note - 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change > Location 2263</p><p>开一个梦想账户，当你想买东西时，直接转入替代账户。</p><p>Highlight(blue) - 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change > Location 2266</p><p>One of my readers and his wife used a similar setup. They wanted to stop eating out so much and start cooking together more. They labeled their savings account “Trip to Europe.” Whenever they skipped going out to eat, they transferred $50 into the account. At the end of the year, they put the money toward the vacation.</p><p>Highlight(blue) - 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change > Location 2275</p><p>You do it because it’s who you are and it feels good to be you. The more a habit becomes part of your life, the less you need outside encouragement to follow through. Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit.</p><p>Highlight(blue) - 15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change > Location 2281</p><p>Chapter Summary The 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it satisfying. We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards. The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided. To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful—even if it’s in a small way. The first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change—make it satisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time.</p><p>Highlight(blue) - 16: How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day > Location 2301</p><p>Making progress is satisfying, and visual measures—like moving paper clips or hairpins or marbles—provide clear evidence of your progress. As a result, they reinforce your behavior and add a little bit of immediate satisfaction to any activity. Visual measurement comes in many forms: food journals, workout logs, loyalty punch cards, the progress bar on a software download, even the page numbers in a book. But perhaps the best way to measure your progress is with a habit tracker.</p><p>Highlight(blue) - 16: How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day > Location 2412</p><p>Chapter Summary One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress. A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit—like marking an X on a calendar. Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress. Don’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive. Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible. Just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing.</p><p>Note - 16: How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day > Location 2417</p><p>Kindle 的连续读书多少天何尝不是一种习惯进度条呢？</p><p>Highlight(yellow) - 17: How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything > Location 2493</p><p>Chapter Summary The inversion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it unsatisfying. We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or unsatisfying. An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion of us. A habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any behavior. It makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful. Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful motivator.</p><p>Note - 17: How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything > Location 2498</p><p>对坏习惯进行监督与惩罚</p><p>ADVANCED TACTICS: How to Go from Being Merely Good to Being Truly Great</p><p>Highlight(blue) - 18: The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don’t) > Location 2686</p><p>Chapter Summary The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition. Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle. Genes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances. Habits are easier when they align with your natural abilities. Choose the habits that best suit you. Play a game that favors your strengths. If you can’t find a game that favors you, create one. Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on.</p><p>Note - 18: The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don’t) > Location 2692</p><p>选者你适合的领域</p><p>Highlight(blue) - 19: The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work > Location 2717</p><p>The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty. If you love tennis and try to play a serious match against a four-year-old, you will quickly become bored. It’s too easy. You’ll win every point. In contrast, if you play a professional tennis player like Roger Federer or Serena Williams, you will quickly lose motivation because the match is too difficult.</p><p>Note - 19: The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work > Location 2720</p><p>人喜欢挑战，但是没有胜率或者没有互动的挑战无法坚持</p><p>Highlight(blue) - 19: The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work > Location 2723</p><p>The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities.

The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. As habits become routine, they become less interesting and less satisfying. We get bored. Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s the ability to keep going when work isn’t exciting that makes the difference. Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.</p><p>Note - 19: The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work > Location 2796</p><p>成功的敌人不是失败，而是无趣与无聊，所以我们必须让它有趣。 做产品也是一样，必须一开始就有人用，有互动，有反馈，否则你坚持不下去的。一定要从一开始就有种子用户，开发中的时候就有一个群的人在期待。</p><p>Highlight(blue) - 20: The Downside of Creating Good Habits > Location 2938</p><p>Chapter Summary The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors.

The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow beyond it.</p><p>Highlight(blue) - Conclusion: The Secret to Results That Last > Location 2982</p><p>That’s the power of atomic habits.
