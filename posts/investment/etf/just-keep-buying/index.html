(Ch. 21)\nIntroduction Highlight(yellow) - Page 9 · Location 118\nTo build wealth it didn’t matter when you bought U.S. stocks, just that you bought them and kept buying them. It didn’t matter if valuations were high or low. It didn’t matter if you were in a bull market or a bear market. All that mattered was that you kept buying.\nHighlight(yellow) - Page 10 · Location 124\nWhen I say income-producing assets, I mean those assets that you expect to generate income for you far into the future, even if that income isn’t paid directly to you. This includes stocks, bonds, real estate, and much more.

What Should You Invest In? \u003e Page 127 · Location 2023\nThe best way to combat such emotional volatility is to focus on the long term. While this does not guarantee returns, the evidence of history suggests that, with enough time, stocks tend to make up for their periodic losses. Time is an equity investor’s friend.\nHighlight(yellow) - 11. What Should You Invest In? \u003e Page 128 · Location 2041\nStocks Summary Average compounded annual return: 8%–10%. Pros: High historic returns. Easy to own and trade. Low maintenance (someone else runs the business). Cons: High volatility.

What Should You Invest In? \u003e Page 130 · Location 2076\nWhy You Should/ Shouldn’t Invest in Bonds I recommend bonds because of these characteristics: Bonds tend to rise when stocks (and other risky assets) fall. Bonds have a more consistent income stream than other assets. Bonds can provide liquidity to rebalance your portfolio or cover liabilities.\nHighlight(yellow) - 11.

What Should You Invest In? \u003e Page 147 · Location 2351\nWhat About Gold, Crypto, Art, Etc? A handful of asset classes did not make the above list for the simple reason that they don’t produce income. Gold, cryptocurrency, commodities, art, and wine have no reliable income stream associated with their ownership, so I have not included them in my list of income-producing assets. Of course, this does not mean that you can’t make money with these assets. What it does mean is that their valuations are based solely on perception—what someone else is willing to pay for them. Without underlying cash flows, perception is everything. Note - 11. What Should You Invest In? \u003e Page 147 · Location 2357 没有现金流\nHighlight(yellow) - 12.

Why You Shouldn’t Buy Individual Stocks \u003e Page 151 · Location 2487\nThe mental turmoil. The fear of missing out. The elation, triumph, pain, and regret. It was all perfectly packaged into a single two-hour window. Battling emotions is just the tip of the stock picking iceberg. I know because I used to pick stocks years ago as well. In addition to the emotional difficulties, you also have to deal with periods of underperformance and the possibility that you don’t actually have any stock picking skill.\nHighlight(yellow) - 12. Why You Shouldn’t Buy Individual Stocks \u003e Page 157 · Location 2576\n“The very best way to learn about the dangers of individual stock investing is to familiarize yourself with the basics of finance and the empirical literature. But if you can’t do that, then, sure, what you have to do is put 5% or 10% of your money into individual stocks. And make sure you rigorously calculate your return, your annualized return, and then ask yourself, ‘Could I have done better just by buying a total stock market index fund?’” 82\nHighlight(yellow) - 13. How Soon Should You Invest? \u003e Page 161 · Location 2649\nMost stock markets go up most of the time. This is true despite the chaotic and sometimes destructive course of human history. As Warren Buffett so eloquently stated: “In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a flu epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497.”\nHighlight(yellow) - 13. How Soon Should You Invest? \u003e Page 161 · Location 2658\nGiven this empirical evidence, it suggests that you should invest your money as soon as possible. Why is this? Because most markets going up most of the time means that every day you end up waiting to invest usually means higher prices you will have to pay in the future. So, instead of waiting for the best time to get invested, you should just take the plunge and invest what you can now.\nHighlight(yellow) - 13. How Soon Should You Invest? \u003e Page 161 · Location 2664\nImagine you have been gifted $ 1 million and you want to grow it as much as possible over the next 100 years. However, you can only undertake one of two possible investment strategies. You must either: Invest all your cash now, or Invest 1% of your cash each year for the next 100 years. Which would you prefer? If we assume that the assets you are investing in will increase in value over time (otherwise why would you be investing?), then it should be clear that buying now will be better than buying over the course of 100 years. Waiting a century to get invested means buying at ever higher prices while your uninvested cash also loses value to inflation.\nHighlight(yellow) - 13.

How Soon Should You Invest? \u003e Page 176 · Location 2909\nIf you think that the market is overvalued and due for a major pullback, you may need to wait years, if ever, before you are vindicated. Consider this before you use valuation as an excuse to stay in cash.\nHighlight(yellow) - 13. How Soon Should You Invest? \u003e Page 176 · Location 2911\nFinal Summary When deciding between investing all your money now or over time, it is almost always better to invest it now. This is true across all asset classes, time periods, and nearly all valuation regimes. Generally, the longer you wait to deploy your capital, the worse off you will be.\nHighlight(yellow) - 13. How Soon Should You Invest? \u003e Page 177 · Location 2915\nI say generally because the only time when you are better off by averaging-in over time is while the market is crashing. However, it is precisely when the market is crashing that you will be the least enthusiastic to invest.\nHighlight(yellow) - 13. How Soon Should You Invest? \u003e Page 177 · Location 2917\nIt is difficult to fight off these emotions, which is why many investors won’t be able to keep buying as the market falls anyways.\nHighlight(yellow) - 13. How Soon Should You Invest? \u003e Page 177 · Location 2919\nIf you are still worried about investing a large sum of money right now, the problem may be that you’re considering a portfolio that is too risky for your liking. What’s the solution to this? Invest your money now into a more conservative portfolio than you normally would.\nHighlight(yellow) - 13.

Because buying the dip only works when you know that a severe decline is coming and you can time it perfectly.\nHighlight(yellow) - 14. Why You Shouldn’t Wait to Buy the Dip \u003e Page 179 · Location 2962\nThe problem is that severe market declines don’t happen too often. In U.S. market history severe dips have only taken place in the 1930s, 1970s, and 2000s. That’s rare. This means that Buy the Dip only has a small chance of beating DCA.\nHighlight(yellow) - 14.

How to Buy During a Crisis \u003e Page 221 · Location 3457\nAs you can see, when U.S. equity markets have gotten cut in half, the future annualized returns usually exceed 25%. This implies that when the market is down by 50%, it’s time to back up the truck and invest as much as you can afford. Of course, you may not have a lot of investable cash to take advantage of these rare occurrences when the market is in turmoil, because of wider economic uncertainty. However, if you do have the cash to spare then the data suggests that it would be wise to take advantage of this buying opportunity.\nHighlight(yellow) - 18.

This emotional vice can make you question every investment decision that you make.\nHighlight(yellow) - 18. When Should You Sell? \u003e Page 226 · Location 3532\nTo avoid this mental turmoil, you should come up with a set of conditions under which you would sell beforehand instead of relying on your emotional state when you are thinking of getting out of a position. This will allow you to sell your investments on your own terms, to a predefined plan. After coming up with a list of reasons myself, I can only find three cases under which you should consider selling an investment: To rebalance. To get out of a concentrated (or losing) position. To meet your financial needs. If you aren’t rebalancing your portfolio, getting out of a concentrated (or losing) position, or trying to meet a financial need, then I see no reason to sell an investment—ever.\nHighlight(yellow) - 18. When Should You Sell? \u003e Page 227 · Location 3546\nit’s usually better to buy immediately rather than over time. The reasoning was simple: since most markets go up most of the time, waiting to buy usually means losing out on upside. When it comes to selling an asset, we can use the same set of reasoning, but come to the opposite conclusion. Since markets tend to go up over time, the optimal thing to do is to sell as late as possible.

A handful of asset classes did not make the above list for the simple reason that they don’t produce income. Gold, cryptocurrency, commodities, art, and wine have no reliable income stream associated with their ownership, so I have not included them in my list of income-producing assets. Of course, this does not mean that you can’t make money with these assets. What it does mean is that their valuations are based solely on perception—what someone else is willing to pay for them. Without underlying cash flows, perception is everything.

Why You Shouldn’t Buy Individual Stocks > Page 151 · Location 2487</strong><br>The mental turmoil. The fear of missing out. The elation, triumph, pain, and regret. It was all perfectly packaged into a single two-hour window. Battling emotions is just the tip of the stock picking iceberg. I know because I used to pick stocks years ago as well. In addition to the emotional difficulties, you also have to deal with periods of underperformance and the possibility that you don’t actually have any stock picking skill.</p><p><strong>Highlight(yellow) - 12. Why You Shouldn’t Buy Individual Stocks > Page 157 · Location 2576</strong><br>“The very best way to learn about the dangers of individual stock investing is to familiarize yourself with the basics of finance and the empirical literature. But if you can’t do that, then, sure, what you have to do is put 5% or 10% of your money into individual stocks. And make sure you rigorously calculate your return, your annualized return, and then ask yourself, ‘Could I have done better just by buying a total stock market index fund?’” 82</p><p><strong>Highlight(yellow) - 13. How Soon Should You Invest? > Page 161 · Location 2649</strong><br>Most stock markets go up most of the time. This is true despite the chaotic and sometimes destructive course of human history. As Warren Buffett so eloquently stated: “In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a flu epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497.”</p><p><strong>Highlight(yellow) - 13. How Soon Should You Invest? > Page 161 · Location 2658</strong><br>Given this empirical evidence, it suggests that you should invest your money as soon as possible. Why is this? Because most markets going up most of the time means that every day you end up waiting to invest usually means higher prices you will have to pay in the future. So, instead of waiting for the best time to get invested, you should just take the plunge and invest what you can now.</p><p><strong>Highlight(yellow) - 13. How Soon Should You Invest? > Page 161 · Location 2664</strong><br>Imagine you have been gifted $ 1 million and you want to grow it as much as possible over the next 100 years. However, you can only undertake one of two possible investment strategies. You must either: Invest all your cash now, or Invest 1% of your cash each year for the next 100 years. Which would you prefer? If we assume that the assets you are investing in will increase in value over time (otherwise why would you be investing?), then it should be clear that buying now will be better than buying over the course of 100 years. Waiting a century to get invested means buying at ever higher prices while your uninvested cash also loses value to inflation.</p><p><strong>Highlight(yellow) - 13.

In U.S. market history severe dips have only taken place in the 1930s, 1970s, and 2000s. That’s rare. This means that Buy the Dip only has a small chance of beating DCA.</p><p><strong>Highlight(yellow) - 14.

How to Buy During a Crisis > Page 221 · Location 3457</strong><br>As you can see, when U.S. equity markets have gotten cut in half, the future annualized returns usually exceed 25%. This implies that when the market is down by 50%, it’s time to back up the truck and invest as much as you can afford. Of course, you may not have a lot of investable cash to take advantage of these rare occurrences when the market is in turmoil, because of wider economic uncertainty. However, if you do have the cash to spare then the data suggests that it would be wise to take advantage of this buying opportunity.</p><p><strong>Highlight(yellow) - 18.

When Should You Sell? > Page 226 · Location 3530</strong><br>fear of missing out on the upside and the fear of losing money on the downside. This emotional vice can make you question every investment decision that you make.</p><p><strong>Highlight(yellow) - 18. When Should You Sell? > Page 226 · Location 3532</strong><br>To avoid this mental turmoil, you should come up with a set of conditions under which you would sell beforehand instead of relying on your emotional state when you are thinking of getting out of a position. This will allow you to sell your investments on your own terms, to a predefined plan. After coming up with a list of reasons myself, I can only find three cases under which you should consider selling an investment: To rebalance. To get out of a concentrated (or losing) position. To meet your financial needs. If you aren’t rebalancing your portfolio, getting out of a concentrated (or losing) position, or trying to meet a financial need, then I see no reason to sell an investment—ever.</p><p><strong>Highlight(yellow) - 18. When Should You Sell? > Page 227 · Location 3546</strong><br>it’s usually better to buy immediately rather than over time. The reasoning was simple: since most markets go up most of the time, waiting to buy usually means losing out on upside. When it comes to selling an asset, we can use the same set of reasoning, but come to the opposite conclusion. Since markets tend to go up over time, the optimal thing to do is to sell as late as possible. Therefore, selling over time (or as late as possible) is usually better than selling right away.</p><p><strong>Highlight(yellow) - 18.

It coincides with our annual tax season.</p><p><strong>Highlight(yellow) - 18. When Should You Sell? > Page 234 · Location 3642</strong><br>Whatever you decide to do when it comes to rebalancing frequency, avoiding unnecessary taxation is a must. This is why I don’t recommend rebalancing frequently in your taxable accounts (i.e., brokerage account). Because every time you do, you have to pay Uncle Sam.</p><p><strong>Highlight(yellow) - 18. When Should You Sell? > Page 235 · Location 3647</strong><br>While selling an asset to rebalance isn’t the worst thing in the world, there is a way to rebalance your portfolio that involves no tax consequences at all—Just Keep Buying. That’s right. You can buy your way back into a rebalanced portfolio. I call this an accumulation rebalance because you are rebalancing by buying your most underweight asset over time.</p><p><strong>Highlight(yellow) - 18.
