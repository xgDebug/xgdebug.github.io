&lt;p&gt;Hugo 是一款很好用的静态网站生成框架,很多人用它来写 Blog,并且部署在 github pages 上，但是这个方案只能在电脑上使用，每次要写文章都需要打开电脑。 我强烈的需要一个时刻都能记录自己思考的方案,在思绪飞扬时打开手机就能马上把它记录下来。所以也就需要一款能在手机上操作的 APP。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;成功的敌人不是失败，而是无趣与无聊，所以我们必须让它有趣。 做产品也是一样，必须一开始就有人用，有互动，有反馈，否则你坚持不下去的。一定要从一开始就有种子用户，开发中的时候就有一个群的人在期待。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit of Financial Discipline:&lt;/strong&gt; Become someone who practices disciplined financial management. This could involve habits such as creating a budget, tracking expenses, and avoiding unnecessary spending.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit of Continuous Learning:&lt;/strong&gt; Embrace the identity of a lifelong learner in the realm of personal finance. Make it a habit to read books, articles, and attend seminars on financial literacy and investment strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit of Savvy Investing:&lt;/strong&gt; Cultivate the identity of an informed and strategic investor. Regularly set aside time to research investment opportunities and make informed decisions about where to invest your money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit of Goal Setting:&lt;/strong&gt; Adopt the identity of a goal-oriented individual. Set clear financial goals and break them down into actionable steps. Regularly review and adjust your goals as needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit of Networking and Relationship Building:&lt;/strong&gt; Become someone who actively seeks out connections in the financial world. Network with professionals, mentors, and like-minded individuals who can provide guidance and opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit of Entrepreneurial Thinking:&lt;/strong&gt; Develop an identity that embraces entrepreneurial thinking. This might involve exploring side businesses, investments in startups, or other ventures that can diversify your income streams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit of Long-Term Planning:&lt;/strong&gt; Embody the identity of a strategic planner. Develop a habit of thinking about your financial future in the long term, which includes retirement planning, estate planning, and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit of Resilience:&lt;/strong&gt; Cultivate the identity of a resilient individual who learns from setbacks. Financial success often involves facing challenges; adopting the habit of bouncing back and learning from failures is crucial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit of Generosity:&lt;/strong&gt; Adopt the identity of someone who values giving back. Allocate a portion of your financial success to charitable causes, reinforcing the idea that financial success enables positive impact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit of Risk Management:&lt;/strong&gt; Become someone who is conscious of financial risks. Develop habits of managing and mitigating risks through insurance, emergency funds, and thoughtful decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Habit of Negotiation and Assertiveness:&lt;/strong&gt; Embrace an identity of someone who advocates for their financial interests. Develop the habit of negotiating for better deals, raises, and terms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, the key is to start small and build gradually. Choose one or a few of these habits that resonate with you and incorporate them into your daily routine. As you consistently practice these habits, they will become ingrained in your identity, leading to more sustainable and impactful changes in your financial life. Over time, these small identity-based habits can accumulate and lead to significant financial success.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;生活中，总会有一些看似平常的事物，却蕴含着深刻的哲理。就拿蜜蜂和甜蜜来说吧，我们或许很少思考过这背后的故事。蜜蜂，它们是大自然中的勤劳者，辛勤地采集花蜜，转化为甜蜜的珍馐。而这些甜蜜，则成了人们生活中的美味享受，让人们沐浴在幸福的滋味中。&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>生活中，总会有一些看似平常的事物，却蕴含着深刻的哲理。就拿蜜蜂和甜蜜来说吧，我们或许很少思考过这背后的故事。蜜蜂，它们是大自然中的勤劳者，辛勤地采集花蜜，转化为甜蜜的珍馐。而这些甜蜜，则成了人们生活中的美味享受，让人们沐浴在幸福的滋味中。</p>
<p>然而，深入思考一下，我们或许能发现，蜜蜂的辛勤努力和人们享受的甜蜜之间，似乎隐藏着一些不为人知的隐情。或许在这背后，是一种看似不经意却又深刻的寓意。我们可以从中联想到一些似曾相识的场景。</p>
<p>曾经，有这样一个地方，那里的人们过着平凡的生活，但却感受着来自上层的无形压力。他们被要求付出更多的努力，为了所谓的“幸福”而默默耕耘。这些人们，如同蜜蜂一般，辛勤地工作，将他们的汗水和辛劳转化为所谓的“甜蜜”，然而那“甜蜜”又是否真正属于他们自己呢？</p>
<p>那些上层，他们或许并没有像蜜蜂一样，为这份“甜蜜”付出过同样的努力。却因为某种力量，享受着人们努力换来的“甜蜜”，似乎理所当然。而人们，或许也习惯了这样的生活，忍受着他们内心的无奈，继续为那份所谓的“甜蜜”不断努力，仿佛生活的意义就只存在于这份“甜蜜”中。</p>
<p>然而，如果我们再次回归蜜蜂的故事，或许能找到一些反思的线索。蜜蜂虽然辛劳，但它们也在为自己创造生活的同时，也为大自然的生态平衡做出了贡献。而人们，或许也应该思考，在追求表面上的“甜蜜”的同时，是否也能够为自己创造更多的可能性，为社会带来更多的美好？</p>
<p>当我们看待那些被视作“蜜蜂”的人们时，或许也应该更加关注他们是否能够在劳作的同时，获得应有的尊重和公平。或许，在这样的思考中，我们能够更加客观地看待那些所谓的“甜蜜”，以及它们背后所隐藏的价值观。毕竟，蜜蜂不勤劳辛苦，哪来的甜蜜？生活中的每一份努力，都应该得到应有的回报，而不仅仅是片刻的虚幻“甜蜜”。</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;公司希望你成为螺丝钉，可被替代。&lt;br&gt;
你希望自己无可替代，甚至拥有独立盈利的能力，成为公司。&lt;br&gt;
所以只会在某些阶段，双方的利益与目标一致，过了这个阶段就该分开了。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>There was a sizeable market with an apparent, shared, and critical problem. The problem was solvable, but no one had yet built anything to make it noticeably easier.</p>

<p>So, we released it to the public, built a landing page, and waited. Nothing happened. One or two people signed up for the free trial, but there was not much else. We hadn&rsquo;t done any marketing, and we hadn&rsquo;t made any sales. The service just sat there, idling.</p>

<p>And then, one day, everything changed. In a comment to a Facebook post about how teachers dealt with feedback, Danielle dropped the link to our product with an explanation of how she used it. Teachers started to respond, asking for more details, they checked out the program, and came back to share their newly found discovery on social media.</p>

<p>that fueled the growth of our business from its first few users to thousands of customers a couple of months later. It was surreal, but we had tapped into a highly active tribe. Once we understood that, we didn&rsquo;t need to do much when it came to marketing our product: our users would do most of that for us.</p>

<p>For many of our customers, teaching from home was a side hustle. Using our product enabled many of them to turn this into a full-time source of income. We priced our service to be affordable and easily justified. We even increased our prices by 50% a year into running the business, and it continued growing nevertheless.</p>

<p>Tech founders—and I count myself as one—focus on products because that is what we use to solve our problems. After all, when you run into a challenging task, what do you look for first? An in-depth scientific explanation for the epistemological essence of the task? Or a tool that will do the job for you seconds after you install it?</p>

<p>作为一个技术宅,万不可太沉迷于技术,应该关注产品。解决问题而不是研究科学。能用就行</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) - Location 368</p>
<p>Successful businesses are built by solving critical problems for an audience that will pay for a solution to their issues. The Preparation Stage is when you make these foundational choices. Once in motion, a business has certain inertia that makes these decisions hard to change. Even though pivoting your business into new markets is sometimes the right choice, it’s extra effort. That’s why it’s a good idea to spend considerable time on getting it right in the first place.</p>

<p>一句话总结就是产品必须要真的有价值</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) - Location 385</p>
<p>Many successful bootstrapped businesses start with an audience, a specific niche. They find their customers&rsquo; critical problems and provide valuable solutions that people gladly pay for. Their product is centered around continuously providing value to new and existing customers. Audience, problem, solution, and product can be looked at individually.</p>

Find a good solution and make sure it fits into your prospective customers&rsquo; workflow in Step Three: Your Solution. What can I create to help them that way?

<p>A business would be nothing without customers. You can have the best product in the world, but you won’t be able to build any meaningful business if there is no one to pay for what you offer.</p>

<p>where do you find those paying customers? The first step to building a business is answering that question, and for bootstrapped founders, there is one critical component: finding the perfect niche.</p>

<p>Highlight(pink) - Location 406</p>
<p>For a bootstrapped business, the choice of your target audience has a few significant limitations: you will have to be careful to find a market that sits in the Goldilocks Zone between too small and too big, and, at best, it should grow in a certain way. You will discover how to find the numbers and figures to make informed choices about your audience.</p>

<p>sometimes we look for immutable things like age or gender niches. Other times the specifics we’re interested in are fluid things like preferences or experience levels. Some niches can be large enough to contain millions of people, and others might just consist of a handful of individuals.</p>
<p>Note - Location 423</p>

<p>Highlight(orange) - Location 424</p>
<p>What unites all niches is that they are inclusive of some and exclusive of others. The members of the in-group will be reasonably similar, depending on the specificity of the niche. That’s why niches work so well for bootstrapped businesses: if you can provide a tool that solves a niche problem very well, you can be sure that everyone in the niche will be interested in it.</p>

<p>InBev, the makers of Bud Light, spend more than $1.5 billion every year. They do that because they need to be present in the mind of every single shopper when they think of getting a beer.</p>

<p>A craft beer company might put up flyers in a local pub that is serving lots of craft beers, or allocate a budget to exhibiting at beer festivals. A niche business will market to its niche and no one else.</p>

<p>Highlight(orange) - Location 436</p>
<p>If you filter a large group of people by several specific properties, you will end up with an audience that shares those properties. As a result, these people will also share many other things that can make building products and selling them very convenient.</p>
<p>Note - Location 438</p>

<p>Highlight(blue) - Location 438</p>
<p>People in your niche will likely have the same problems. If they love fantasy football, they all need to keep track of their teams. If they enjoy fly-fishing, they all need to find information on where to fish and how the weather will impact their chances of a catch. If you spend enough time investigating the problems of your niche, you will sooner or later surface their critical problems. These are the things that are common roadblocks for everyone in the niche. Solving that problem with a dedicated product will allow you to have a high chance of success with your bootstrapped business.</p>

<p>Highlight(yellow) - Location 457</p>
<p>you can become a tribe leader yourself. There is room for a lot of leaders in most niche tribes. In such a position, you are regarded as an expert who also offers a product specifically designed for members of the tribe.</p>

<p>Note - Location 461</p>
<p>部落认同感的人都会想要融入，成为部落标配是个极好的营销</p>

<p>The better you define your niche market, the more confident you can be in your numbers.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) - Location 481</p>
<p>Shared interests will allow you to speak to the needs of your niche audience directly. Creating content that has a lot of impact and will be read by a lot of people will be easier, as there is less competition for your audience’s attention.</p>
<p>Note - Location 483</p>
<p>部落聚集便于宣传</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) - Location 488</p>
<p>Partnerships in niches become a much more lucrative endeavor. Additional exposure and reach results in quick win-win situations, where both partners can significantly boost both their customer base and their reputation as an expert in the niche. Partnering up with other players in the niche allows you to reach customers at different stages of “niche proficiency,” increasing the breadth of your sales funnel.</p>

<p>网络部落的力量</p>
<p>Highlight(pink) - Location 496</p>
<p>If you give people the opportunities to share your content and messages with other tribe members, they will. The interconnected nature of tribes facilitates this rapid exchange of information, and if you leverage those channels, your product will sell itself. At FeedbackPanda, it took one well-placed social media comment to start an avalanche of word-of-mouth referrals that lasted for years.</p>

<p>Luckily, these influencers are also much cheaper to partner with than the prominent super-influencers. Often, they are not even aware of their influence, or they don’t necessarily see it as a monetizable activity. While I recommend you still offer them reasonable compensation, you can approach niche influencers as potential partners instead of just seeing them as a marketing channel.</p>

<p>与意见领袖合作是个不错的推广方法</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) - Location 517</p>
<p>Analyze your competitors for what they do well and what they don’t when you do your market research. If you’ve done your problem validation right, you will see gaps in the market that are not yet served. Build your products around those gaps, and look into partnering with your competitors to expand each other’s customer base.</p>
<p>Note - Location 519</p>

<p>Highlight(blue) - Location 519</p>
<p>Look out for non-competitor competitive alternatives: the things people use instead of using an actual product. This can be Post-It notes, an Excel spreadsheet that does not involve numbers, anything that is a general tool applied to a specific problem. These types of makeshift solutions are where you can find your critical problems—and that is where you can best serve your niche.</p>

<p>Like in machine learning, you run the risk of “overfitting” your niche; you might get too specific. There could be a few hundred “Star Trek fans that live in the New Orleans area and love to eat Quinoa,” but that won’t sustain a bootstrapped business.</p>
<p>Note - Location 526</p>
<p>市场规模过小，无法维持一个生意</p>
<p>Highlight(orange) - Location 530</p>
<p>In the best case, this will be the critical problem of everyone in the niche, and your product will ideally solve it well enough for your customers to tell everyone they know, and allow your product to sell itself.</p>
<p>Highlight(pink) - Location 534</p>
<p>A bootstrapped business works best when it starts out in a niche. Most companies will do really well by just staying there. Some expand into other markets. But that initial audience is one of the most important things to carefully select when you start a business.</p>

<p>A problem we experienced for ourselves. So we solved it for ourselves. We then saw that other teachers, just like Danielle, could benefit from our solution. They had the exact same problem.

<p>Is the Audience Large Enough? Your audience will have to be big enough to sustain your business. It will likely also have to support competitors, as any successful business will attract competition.</p>
<p>Highlight(blue) - Location 549</p>
<p>Is the Audience Small Enough? Contrary to popular belief, I think that for a bootstrapped company, in particular, some markets can be too big. Some audiences are too generic, some industries too vast for a great niche to exist. At least, in the beginning, you should have a clearly defined niche. As a bootstrapped entrepreneur, you will reach out to customers and be in direct contact.</p>
<p>Highlight(blue) - Location 557</p>
<p>Can They Pay? Will They Pay? Sometimes, you will be serving companies that have a budget for what you offer. Other times, you could help a currently underserved segment of a low-wage industry. The capacity and willingness to pay will be very different between those two.</p>

<p>If you have found a painful problem, a niche audience that is both small and big enough for your business, and you have made sure your audience is willing to pay for your solution, you have found your niche. From here you can build out your product and marketing strategies for that market.</p>

<p>Highlight(yellow) - Location 583</p>
<p>Knowing if you need to focus more on sales or on marketing is very important. Some markets require you to reach out to buyers individually. For others, a good and well-targeted marketing strategy could mean you will never have to talk to a single customer before they subscribe or purchase. Being aware of how this will develop over time is essential in order to decide where to focus your attention.</p>

<p>What Are Good Markets for Bootstrapped SaaS? If you see that significant forces are terraforming a market, creating an opportunity where there was none before, that is a good sign. Whenever a new kind of technology or process gets traction in a field that has not seen much change before, it will create little points of friction. Some of them will be critical. These will be the ones that warrant creating a SaaS business.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) - Location 593</p>
<p>Some markets, where a lot of small deciders with their own budgets make decisions, are very lucrative. These people can be convinced without needing to deploy corporate diplomacy. You can show them a product, and they will try it out, as they have no one telling them not to. Small businesses and freelancers are great audiences for a bootstrapped SaaS, as they have budgets. Small budgets, maybe, but if there is a painful problem, there will be money to fix it.</p>

<p>What Are Bad Markets for Bootstrapped SaaS?</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) - Location 601</p>
<p>Enterprise markets are hard to sell into for a small company, although it’s not impossible. Purchasing decisions take a long time, there are a lot of requirements even to be considered, and contracts tend to be custom and require a lot of work. Many enterprise customers won’t buy from small companies out of fear they will vanish within a few years, and that fear is not unfounded. In fact, even for your own bootstrapped business, I would recommend against using services offered by companies smaller than yourself. You will be better off looking for a market that is comprised of small to medium-sized businesses and self-employed freelancers.</p>

<p>Identifying a Critical Problem: Working on the Right Thing Once you have found a suitable audience, you can start looking for problems. The great thing about niche markets is that the issues in them are specific and shared by the people in the niche. Solving a common problem will help a lot of people.

<p>A Critical Problem Is Painful Problems can be a nuisance. They come up, and you either deal with them or ignore them. We can’t ignore critical problems. They persistently make the lives of those who have them harder until they are resolved. They can’t be just ignored, because they consistently reduce the quality of life.</p>

<p>A Critical Problem Is Not Optional Some things can be ignored or delegated, but a critical problem can’t be. If it’s critical, people will have to deal with the problem every time it occurs. They can’t just opt out of it. Solving the problem is essential to making any kind of progress in the work.</p>

<p>A Critical Problem Occurs Frequently and Repeatedly The reason why critical problems are always on the minds of your customers is that the problems happen so often. Every day, every week, every month, the critical problems repeatedly occur. For your customers, it’s always the most urgent thing at that time. The issue needs to be solved there and then, every single time. If it’s not frequent, it is likely not a critical problem. If it occurs repeatedly and isn’t easily solved, it is likely to be a critical problem.</p>

<p>Highlight(yellow) - Location 801</p>
<p>A Critical Problem Takes up Too Much Time If a problem can be solved quickly, people either solve it the moment it appears or they set aside some time to do the work in a batch later, without feeling like it’s a waste of time. If that is the case, the problem is not really critical. Only when you need to spend considerable time and effort each time you solve the problem will it be impossible to “just” deal with it. “Doing it later” also turns into a chore, as it may take hours or days to deal with a long queue of deferred problems. A critical problem will feel like an unwelcome chore: important, yet tiresome.</p>

<p>A Critical Problem Forces People to Solve It Using Their Own System There is the joke that every SaaS is an Excel sheet transformed into business logic. The moment someone uses generic tools like word processors or spreadsheets to solve a problem, it’s an indicator that the problem is valuable enough to build tools. Most problems don’t have high complexity, and they can be solved on the spot. But a critical issue will be complicated enough to start developing a system. If your customers have a pile of Post-its or a chaotic assortment of Word and Excel files to solve a problem, you may have found a critical problem.</p>

<p>They Have No Interest in Paying With non-critical problems, customers often find alternative ways of solving the problem because they want to save money. It’s not worthwhile for them to look for and pay for a solution that they value less than alternative solutions.</p>
<p>Note - Location 840</p>
<p>可以不愿意花钱解决的问题不是关键痛点</p>
<p>Highlight(blue) - Location 853</p>
<p>Finding the Critical Problem So, how can you learn about which is the most critical problem your customers have? It’s quite straightforward: talk to them. Ask them what annoys them most. Find out where they want to be. Ask them what keeps them from being the best at what they are doing.</p>
<p>Note - Location 856</p>
<p>发现痛点最直接的方式就是和他们聊聊</p>
<p>Highlight(blue) - Location 859</p>
<p>Focus on what you can help them accomplish. Ask what customers want and which state they want to be in when the work is done. Don’t focus too much on the “how it’s done.” That is usually more based on tradition than on an optimized process.</p>
<p>Note - Location 861</p>
<p>直接询问客户想要什么产品是不行的，你需要知道他们在用过你的产品后会达到什么状态来判断</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) - Location 867</p>
<p>If you find something that will obviously make them significantly more money or save them a lot of time, then you have something to go on. Customers should really want to pay for it, almost have a burning desire to open their wallets. When they ask you if that is possible and you tell them it is, their mouth should drop to the floor.</p>

<p>Time-Related Pains Most productivity-related issues cause temporal pain: people feel like they’re wasting time. These pains are caused by suboptimal processes and friction between tasks. If tedious work takes a lot of time, it keeps you from doing important and useful things instead. That leads to time mismanagement and relevant actions not being taken. By solving the time-related problem, productive tasks can be accomplished faster and sooner. When people complain about inefficiencies, tedium, or pointless work, you’re looking at a time-related problem.</p>

<p>浪费时间是最大的痛苦</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) - Location 896</p>
<p>If you hear people complaining about a waste of money, prohibitive costs, compliance, or the wrong people working on the wrong things, you’ve found a resource-related problem.</p>

<p>Self-Related Pains This group of problems is often overlooked. Everyone wants to be notable somewhere. This can mean holding a position in a company or being regarded as a supportive co-worker or friend. When people struggle with achieving these things, they feel self-related pains. The four essential concepts to look out for here are Reputation, Accomplishment, Advancement, and Empowerment.</p>

<p>Highlight(blue) - Location 1077</p>
<p>Avoid People Who Are Trying to Please You Compliments are a problem. They don’t help you. If compliments happen, ignore them. If the customer continues to compliment everything you do, the data will not help you. You can salvage these types of conversations. Dive deep into problems and their implications. Completely ignore any of their opinions about your product, your ideas, or your plans. Focus exclusively on their day-to-day operations, and redirect all talk of your product toward their experiences.</p>
<p>Note - Location 1080</p>
<p>忽略那些给你好评的人，他们的夸奖对于你改进产品没有价值</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) - Location 1095</p>
<p>Avoid People Who Only Tell You Their Ideas You are validating a problem, not your customer’s assumption. If they are barraging you with their ideas, you will be limited to the outcomes of their perception, not the reality of their problems. Customers have a hard time understanding what they truly value, so their solutions are limited to what they know. Experts can be blinded by years of routine, overvaluing the status quo, and undervaluing even paradigm-shifting improvements.</p>
<p>Note - Location 1099</p>
<p>不要相信有很多想法的客户，他们并不懂自己真正想要的是什么</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) - Location 1139</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs are good at coming up with ideas. We envision solutions to the problems that trouble the audience we have chosen to help. We think deeply about a problem, mentally shape a product, and see how much it would benefit the quality of life. Then we get to work and build the prototype, eager to release it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Note - Location 1141</p>
<p>解决方案不是凭空冒出来的，要在实践中获得</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) - Location 1161</p>
<p>A good question here is, &ldquo;At what stage of your workflow will you be using this solution?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) - Location 1223</p>
<p>Throughout your solution validation conversations, you want to project a clear interest in solving your customer&rsquo;s problems without causing new ones. If you communicate this clearly in each call, you will create goal alignment between you and your prospect: you both want a great solution that makes things easier for the customer.</p>

<p>Highlight(orange) - Location 1226</p>
<p>Asking the Right Questions: Focus on Problems not Solutions When you talk to your customers or prospects, you will find that there are questions that always produce meaningful results: where they are now? Where do they want to be? What stands in the way of getting there? Essentially, this is applying the jobs-to-be-done framework to your communication strategy, trying to find their realistic and aspirational states, and then building a solution that allows them to go from one state to the other.</p>
<p>Note - Location 1231</p>
<p>问出正确的问题，关注问题本身而不是解决方案</p>
<p>Highlight(orange) - Location 1246</p>
<p>So, what should you ask about? Ask about where progress is hindered. Progress is a clear indicator of jobs-to-be-done. After all, you have to move from what is to what ought to be in some way. Progress is that transition. Ask people where they perceive it. Ask about tension and friction during value creation. Where are things harder to accomplish than they ought to be? That is why your customers want to use your product. Once you have found hindered progress, tension, or friction, discover the underlying needs and desired outcomes of the processes involved. Ask about the context of the job-to-be-done: who is involved, who holds the stakes, and who is ultimately responsible for the job-to-be-done?</p>

<p>the MVP, the Minimum Viable Product.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) - Location 1269</p>
<p>a few general guidelines that will make sure you can create a product that stands a chance: Your product will never be finished—treat it as an ongoing concern at all times. Allow for quick and safe releases, release early, and release often. The less exciting your tech choices, the better. The fewer things you have to build yourself, the better.</p>
<p>Note - Location 1272</p>
<p>关注的是产品，而不是技术与完成度。敏捷迭代</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) - Location 1274</p>
<p>“If you&rsquo;re not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you have launched too late.”</p>
<p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1426</p>
<p>While you will likely be adding and changing features more than removing them in the early stages of your business, prepare that eventually, you will need to remove features. Avoid becoming too attached. You may be reluctant to remove something you spent a lot of time on. However, you&rsquo;d rather have a slim and focused product than a behemoth that does a thousand things, but none of them well.</p>
<p>Note - Location 1428</p>
<p>你的产品应当小而强，并非大而全，核心功能强就好</p>
<p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1436</p>
<p>&ldquo;Art is never finished, only abandoned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Highlight(orange) - Location 1439</p>
<p>If software can never be truly finished, any stage of it is your best guess at what it should be at the time it&rsquo;s created. As the MVP is the first version of your product that your audience will be exposed to, it is crucial to get it &ldquo;right enough&rdquo; while being okay with it not being &ldquo;perfectly right&rdquo; at the same time. The MVP is your first real contact with your customers. It has two main functions: to allow your early adopters to gauge the value of your service, and to enable you to charge them money to gauge their sincerity. The MVP is the first handshake between you and your customers. To have your MVP leave a great first impression, you will need to scope it sufficiently and time it well.</p>
<p>Note - Location 1444</p>
<p>软件不会被完成，只会被放弃，所以从 MVP 开始就应该收费</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) - Location 1447</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s a minimal product? It&rsquo;s the core functionality only, a simple tool without any fancy additions. What&rsquo;s a viable product? It&rsquo;s the essence of the solution to your audience&rsquo;s problem, a tool that does exactly what it promises to do, and nothing more.</p>
<p>Highlight(pink) - Location 1451</p>
<p>A minimum viable product should contain a few structural components to make it usable by your audience: your users should be able to sign up and log in, solve their problem, and be able to pay for your product. Anything else is cruft, at least for your MVP.</p>
<p>Note - Location 1452</p>
<p>什么是最小可用产品呢？</p>
<p>Highlight(orange) - Location 1473</p>
<p>Timing Your MVP It&rsquo;s incredibly hard to time when your MVP is done. Here&rsquo;s the problem: you&rsquo;re much too invested. You have the grand vision of what your product could be. And here you are, looking at a version that is slimmed down to the extent of being unrecognizable. It will always feel like it&rsquo;s not good enough yet.</p>
<p>Highlight(yellow) - Location 1479</p>
<p>The happy path for any customer is to ship the MVP as soon as humanly possible. You need your customers to interact with your product at the earliest possible moment. Only then can you find out what works and what doesn&rsquo;t. You need the MVP to become part of their daily workflow.</p>
<p>Highlight(orange) - Location 1488</p>
<p>If you want it to measure customer commitment, add a rudimentary payment system from the beginning. Give liberal amounts of free trial time, but set an end to it. An indefinite trial period could keep people around, but it won&rsquo;t allow you to determine if your product produces enough value to warrant paying for it.</p>

<p>As technical founders, we&rsquo;re supposed to choose the technology that works best for us and our business. But we often let the cargo-culting around the newest, hottest tech stack get to us. Many technical founders see a new startup as an opportunity to figure out a modern tech stack. That is a dangerous move. Not only do you have to deal with the inherently hazardous nature of creating a new business, but now there is also the chance that the new and mostly untested tech stack may not be able to solve the problem you&rsquo;re trying to solve.</p>

<p>A business is more than a landing page, a product, and a bank account. A business is a complex system of processes. Building a product may come easy to you if you&rsquo;re technically inclined, but turning it into a value-generating machine is a whole different kind of challenge. Others may have trouble coming up with the product but thrive on building the structures needed to sell it over and over again.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You built a solution for customers who think they have that problem under control. You solved the wrong problem. You developed a solution that helps only at the margins. You solved the wrong problem. You built something, but your customers have bigger fish to fry. You solved the wrong problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You want to build a “need-to-have” instead of a “nice-to-have.” You want to develop a painkiller instead of a vitamin. You want to be their aspirin. How can this be done? By finding their most important problem: the one issue that is critical to their success.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most crucial problem a customer faces is on their minds most often. It’s the most important because it’s coming up frequently and is never easy to solve. It has the most impact on their lives, but it’s not always the obvious choice. If you can help a customer with their most critical problem, they will benefit the most.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Critical Problem Is Painful Problems can be a nuisance. They come up, and you either deal with them or ignore them. We can’t ignore critical problems. They persistently make the lives of those who have them harder until they are resolved. They can’t be just ignored, because they consistently reduce the quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Find the critical problem where people need to do the same thing over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Critical Problem Occurs Frequently and Repeatedly The reason why critical problems are always on the minds of your customers is that the problems happen so often. Every day, every week, every month, the critical problems repeatedly occur. For your customers, it’s always the most urgent thing at that time. The issue needs to be solved there and then, every single time. If it’s not frequent, it is likely not a critical problem. If it occurs repeatedly and isn’t easily solved, it is likely to be a critical problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Find the critical problem where solving a problem takes a long time every time the problem occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Critical Problem Takes up Too Much Time If a problem can be solved quickly, people either solve it the moment it appears or they set aside some time to do the work in a batch later, without feeling like it’s a waste of time. If that is the case, the problem is not really critical. Only when you need to spend considerable time and effort each time you solve the problem will it be impossible to “just” deal with it. “Doing it later” also turns into a chore, as it may take hours or days to deal with a long queue of deferred problems. A critical problem will feel like an unwelcome chore: important, yet tiresome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;They Have No Interest in Paying With non-critical problems, customers often find alternative ways of solving the problem because they want to save money. It’s not worthwhile for them to look for and pay for a solution that they value less than alternative solutions.&lt;br&gt;
They’ll be willing to pay: if the solution saves them time if the solution saves them money if the solution makes them money&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Critical Problem Forces People to Solve It Using Their Own System There is the joke that every SaaS is an Excel sheet transformed into business logic. The moment someone uses generic tools like word processors or spreadsheets to solve a problem, it’s an indicator that the problem is valuable enough to build tools. Most problems don’t have high complexity, and they can be solved on the spot. But a critical issue will be complicated enough to start developing a system. If your customers have a pile of Post-its or a chaotic assortment of Word and Excel files to solve a problem, you may have found a critical problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you find something that will obviously make them significantly more money or save them a lot of time, then you have something to go on. Customers should really want to pay for it, almost have a burning desire to open their wallets. When they ask you if that is possible and you tell them it is, their mouth should drop to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Focus on what you can help them accomplish. Ask what customers want and which state they want to be in when the work is done. Don’t focus too much on the “how it’s done.” That is usually more based on tradition than on an optimized process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Self-Related Pains This group of problems is often overlooked. Everyone wants to be notable somewhere. This can mean holding a position in a company or being regarded as a supportive co-worker or friend. When people struggle with achieving these things, they feel self-related pains. The four essential concepts to look out for here are Reputation, Accomplishment, Advancement, and Empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Do They Know? The Problem with Problem Awareness When you’re conducting interviews with customers, you will hear them talk a lot about the problems that bother them. These are the known knowns. But your prospects will never be able to tell you about the issues they don’t realize they have.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs are good at coming up with ideas. We envision solutions to the problems that trouble the audience we have chosen to help. We think deeply about a problem, mentally shape a product, and see how much it would benefit the quality of life. Then we get to work and build the prototype, eager to release it as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A good question here is, &amp;ldquo;At what stage of your workflow will you be using this solution?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout your solution validation conversations, you want to project a clear interest in solving your customer&amp;rsquo;s problems without causing new ones. If you communicate this clearly in each call, you will create goal alignment between you and your prospect: you both want a great solution that makes things easier for the customer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Asking the Right Questions: Focus on Problems not Solutions When you talk to your customers or prospects, you will find that there are questions that always produce meaningful results: where they are now? Where do they want to be? What stands in the way of getting there? Essentially, this is applying the jobs-to-be-done framework to your communication strategy, trying to find their realistic and aspirational states, and then building a solution that allows them to go from one state to the other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to start an app business with no money?</title>

      <description>&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use free or low-cost tools. For example, you can build cross-platform apps with frameworks like React Native which don&amp;rsquo;t require paying for multiple native platforms. Use free graphics tools like GIMP instead of Photoshop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Validate your app idea first.&lt;/strong&gt; Get feedback from target users before investing time and money into full development. Create mockups or prototypes to gauge interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider freelancers instead of full-time staff. Hire affordable freelancers to help with things like graphics, marketing, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage app marketplaces&lt;/strong&gt; like App Store and Google Play. They make distribution easy without needing your own marketing budget.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use free promotion channels. Promote your app on social media, forums, blogs relevant to your niche. Reach out to influencers and the press.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monetize with ads. Mobile ads through networks like AdMob can provide revenue even for free apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build up over time and reinvest revenue. Start lean, prove the concept, then grow organically by reinvesting any profits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider crowdfunding. Run a Kickstarter campaign to fund development costs and assess demand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for startup grants and investments. Apply to app startup funding programs and pitch to angel investors once you have traction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is to &lt;strong&gt;start small, validate demand, leverage free/low-cost&lt;/strong&gt; tools and use creativity instead of big capital initially when bootstrapping your app busine&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;sometimes we look for immutable things like age or gender niches. Other times the specifics we’re interested in are fluid things like preferences or experience levels. Some niches can be large enough to contain millions of people, and others might just consist of a handful of individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What unites all niches is that they are inclusive of some and exclusive of others. The members of the in-group will be reasonably similar, depending on the specificity of the niche. That’s why niches work so well for bootstrapped businesses: if you can provide a tool that solves a niche problem very well, you can be sure that everyone in the niche will be interested in it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A craft beer company might put up flyers in a local pub that is serving lots of craft beers, or allocate a budget to exhibiting at beer festivals. A niche business will market to its niche and no one else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;People in your niche will likely have the same problems. If they love fantasy football, they all need to keep track of their teams. If they enjoy fly-fishing, they all need to find information on where to fish and how the weather will impact their chances of a catch. If you spend enough time investigating the problems of your niche, you will sooner or later surface their critical problems. These are the things that are common roadblocks for everyone in the niche. Solving that problem with a dedicated product will allow you to have a high chance of success with your bootstrapped business.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The interconnected nature of tribes facilitates this rapid exchange of information, and if you leverage those channels, your product will sell itself.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Luckily, these influencers are also much cheaper to partner with than the prominent super-influencers. Often, they are not even aware of their influence, or they don’t necessarily see it as a monetizable activity. While I recommend you still offer them reasonable compensation, you can approach niche influencers as potential partners instead of just seeing them as a marketing channel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A problem we experienced for ourselves. So we solved it for ourselves. We then saw that other teachers, just like Danielle, could benefit from our solution. They had the exact same problem. We knew our first version already solved the problem well. That’s why we knew other teachers would pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is the Audience Large Enough? Your audience will have to be big enough to sustain your business. It will likely also have to support competitors, as any successful business will attract competition.&lt;br&gt;
Is the Audience Small Enough? Contrary to popular belief, I think that for a bootstrapped company, in particular, some markets can be too big. Some audiences are too generic, some industries too vast for a great niche to exist. At least, in the beginning, you should have a clearly defined niche. As a bootstrapped entrepreneur, you will reach out to customers and be in direct contact.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Other times, you could help a currently underserved segment of a low-wage industry. The capacity and willingness to pay will be very different between those two.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Knowing if you need to focus more on sales or on marketing is very important. Some markets require you to reach out to buyers individually. For others, a good and well-targeted marketing strategy could mean you will never have to talk to a single customer before they subscribe or purchase. Being aware of how this will develop over time is essential in order to decide where to focus your attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What Are Good Markets for Bootstrapped SaaS? If you see that significant forces are terraforming a market, creating an opportunity where there was none before, that is a good sign. Whenever a new kind of technology or process gets traction in a field that has not seen much change before, it will create little points of friction. Some of them will be critical. These will be the ones that warrant creating a SaaS business.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Some markets, where a lot of small deciders with their own budgets make decisions, are very lucrative. These people can be convinced without needing to deploy corporate diplomacy. You can show them a product, and they will try it out, as they have no one telling them not to. Small businesses and freelancers are great audiences for a bootstrapped SaaS, as they have budgets. Small budgets, maybe, but if there is a painful problem, there will be money to fix it.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Enterprise markets are hard to sell into for a small company, although it’s not impossible. Purchasing decisions take a long time, there are a lot of requirements even to be considered, and contracts tend to be custom and require a lot of work. Many enterprise customers won’t buy from small companies out of fear they will vanish within a few years, and that fear is not unfounded. In fact, even for your own bootstrapped business, I would recommend against using services offered by companies smaller than yourself. You will be better off looking for a market that is comprised of small to medium-sized businesses and self-employed freelancers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Markets where years of ruthless competition have created a large number of bottom feeders are hazardous.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;usually are full of very similar competitors, fighting it out over price and marginal differences. This saturation makes it hard to enter a market, and even the businesses that are already in that market suffer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You also need to validate that this is an actual problem that people need to have addressed. Sometimes, we just want to complain, but we don’t want to change our ways. You will need to find a problem so painful that we just have to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;重复是成功之母。90%以上的成功来自于模仿和重复，而不是来自于创新。&lt;br&gt;
一个人之所以会不想做重复的事，大多是这种情况：这人没做成过什么事，所以没成功的经验。&lt;br&gt;
模仿是最高效的捷径&lt;br&gt;
上学是模仿尖子生、打工模仿优秀员工、做产品是模仿爆款、做自媒体时模仿网红，殊途同归。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We found out that many other teachers did the same when they started talking about their self-built solutions in their online communities. Teachers began to share their templates through Google sheets. It was clear that this was a shared problem in a very tight-knit community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a sizeable market with an apparent, shared, and critical problem. The problem was solvable, but no one had yet built anything to make it noticeably easier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We hadn&amp;rsquo;t done any marketing, and we hadn&amp;rsquo;t made any sales. The service just sat there, idling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In a comment to a Facebook post about how teachers dealt with feedback, Danielle dropped the link to our product with an explanation of how she used it.

They find their customers&amp;rsquo; critical problems and provide valuable solutions that people gladly pay for. Their product is centered around continuously providing value to new and existing customers. Audience, problem, solution, and product can be looked at individually.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Successful businesses are built by solving critical problems for an audience that will pay for a solution to their issues. The Preparation Stage is when you make these foundational choices. Once in motion, a business has certain inertia that makes these decisions hard to change. Even though pivoting your business into new markets is sometimes the right choice, it’s extra effort. That’s why it’s a good idea to spend considerable time on getting it right in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;智力越高的人，越愿意去思考那些惊世骇俗的思想观点。这不仅仅因为聪明人本身很积极地寻找传统观念的漏洞，还因为传统观念对他们的束缚力很小，很容易摆脱。从他们的衣着上你就可以看出这一点：不受传统观念束缚的人，往往也不会穿流行的衣服。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;你不要让自己成为人群的一分子，而要尽可能地远离人群，观察正在发生的事情，特别注意那些被压制的思想和观点&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;如果一个命题不是错的，却被加上各种标签，进行压制和批判，那就有问题。因为只要不是错的观点，就不应该被压制讨论。所以每当你看到有些话被攻击为出自 XX 分子或 XX 主义，这就是一个明确的信号，表明背后有问题。不管在 1630 年还是在 2030 年，都是如此。当你听到有人在用这样的标签，就要问为什么。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>如果你想要清晰地思考，就必须远离人群。但是走得越远，你的处境就会越困难，受到的阻力也会越大，因为你没有迎合社会习俗，而是一步步地与它背道而驰。小时候，每个人都会鼓励你不断成长，变成一个心智成熟、不再耍小孩子脾气的人。但是，很少有人鼓励你继续成长，变成一个怀疑和抵制社会错误潮流的人。如果自己就是潮水的一部分，怎么能看见潮流的方向呢？你只能永远保持质疑。问自己，什么话是我不能说的？为什么？</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;你做别人需要的东西或事情，然后得到报酬。有些人报酬较高，原因很简单，因为他们做得更好。大明星要比普通演员多赚许多钱，普通演员可能也有大明星的实力，但是人们在电影院选择看什么电影时总是被大明星吸引过去。当然，做出人们需要的东西并不是赚钱的唯一方法。抢银行、索贿、垄断市场也能搞到钱，并且是某些富豪最大的财富来源，但是这些手段不能代表财富的全部，更不是贫富分化的主要原因。每个人的技能不同，导致收入不同，这才是贫富分化的主要原因，正如逻辑学的“奥卡姆剃刀”原则所说，简单的解释就是最好的解释&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;工作是人类生命的本质，但不是人类生活的目的。作者认为，人类从出现在地球上开始，就必须通过劳动来获取资源和能量，维持生存和繁衍。但是，工作并不是人类存在的唯一意义，人类还有其他方面的需求和追求，比如休闲、娱乐、社交、创造等。作者呼吁我们不要把工作当成一种信仰，而要把它当成一种手段，为了更好地享受生活。&lt;br&gt;
工作的形式和意义是随着人类文明的演化而变化的。作者从原始社会、农业社会、工业社会到现代社会，梳理了人类工作的历史变迁。他指出，不同的社会形态和经济制度，对工作有不同的定义和要求。在原始社会，人们没有“工作”的概念，只是为了满足基本的生存需求而劳动；在农业社会，人们开始固定居住和耕种，形成了土地所有权和阶级制度；在工业社会，人们被异化成“工具人”，为了经济增长而无休止地工作；在现代社会，人们对工作有更多的期待和挑战，希望通过工作获得价值感和成就感。&lt;br&gt;
稀缺经济学是导致人们过度工作的根源。作者认为，现代社会中普遍存在的“稀缺思维”，让人们担心资源不够用，因而努力工作以获取更多的财富和物质。但是，这种思维忽略了人类对资源的需求是有限的，而且资源本身也不是固定不变的。作者提出，“富足经济学”的概念，认为人类应该从原始社会中学习如何控制欲望，满足于现有的资源，并通过创新和协作来扩大资源的可用性。&lt;br&gt;
自动化技术将给人类带来新的机遇和挑战。作者预测，在未来，机器人将取代人类完成大部分重复性和低技能的工作，这将使人类面临失业和无用的危机。但同时，这也将给人类带来新的可能性，让人类有更多的时间和空间去发展自己感兴趣和擅长的领域，并创造出更多有价值和有意义的工作。作者建议我们重新思考“人之所以为人”的问题，并从“工具人”向“Human Being”转变。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lousy way to do memory prediction is “X happened in the past, therefore X will happen in the future.” It’s too based on specific circumstances. What you want is principles. You want mental models.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;评论引流最早可以追溯到博客时代，批量去别的网站下评论，网名和评论内容就是广告，去成百上千个网站评论，每天就能带来源源不断的流量。&lt;/p&gt;

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>评论引流最早可以追溯到博客时代，批量去别的网站下评论，网名和评论内容就是广告，去成百上千个网站评论，每天就能带来源源不断的流量。</p>
<p>站长圈牛人卢松松，当年坚持在各个博客文章下评论，为后来的流量和名气提供了很大的助力。</p>
<p>在自媒体时代，这套玩法同样有效，重点是简单，人人都能操作。</p>
<p>以最近几年流行的低价网课为例，注册 D 音号，将网名修改为业务名，网名和头像一定要诱惑，让人看了就想点击，提前关注几百个知识博主，只要对方有发布作品，第一时间去评论。</p>
<p>不要发广告，防止被删，评论内容直接套模板就行，给知识类博主留言，就用“get 到了”、“确实有用 感谢分享”、“不错 已收藏了”&hellip;</p>
<p>一个普通视频，保底播放量三五百，几十上百万播放量的爆款也很正常，你的网名和头像在无数次的曝光下，总会有一些人点开，发一些业务相关的视频，签名留下个人微信，每天就会有人加好友，转化率非常稳定。</p>
<p>小白的具体步骤如下：<br>
1.找个高转化率、刚需、市场广泛的细分行业。<br>
2.整理相关资料。<br>
3.注册 D 音，修改网名、头像，发几个业务相关的视频，签名引导加微信。<br>
4.关注 100+优质同行，无脑评论，多多益善。</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The punishment for the love of money is delivered at the same time as the money. As you make money, you just want even more, and you become paranoid and fearful of losing what you do have. There’s no free lunch.&lt;br&gt;
You make money to solve your money and material problems. I think the best way to stay away from this constant love of money is to not upgrade your lifestyle as you make money. It’s very easy to keep upgrading your lifestyle as you make money. But if you can hold your lifestyle fixed and hopefully make your money in giant lump sums as opposed to a trickle at a time, you won’t have time to upgrade your lifestyle. You may get so far ahead you actually become financially free.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You have to put in the time, but the judgment is more important. The direction you’re heading in matters more than how fast you move, especially with leverage. Picking the direction you’re heading in for every decision is far, far more important than how much force you apply. Just pick the right direction to start walking in, and start walking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>富豪，追求高品质，不好糊弄。<br>
中产，追求性价比，斤斤计较。<br>
蠢货，凭本能行事，容易糊弄。</p>
<p>本能包括：贪便宜、情绪化、害怕错过、爱占便宜&hellip;</p>
<p>直播带货，主要靠短视频导流。</p>
<p>什么样的短视频更吸引人？</p>
<p>破产清仓，流眼泪的中年人&hellip; 完美符合下等人的贪便宜 和 情绪化。</p>
<p>哥哥最近刷短视频，看到很多同类视频，套路都一样，生意做不下去了，倒闭了，亏本清仓甩卖。</p>
<p>相同套路的视频，反复发，把丝丝的智商按在地上摩擦。</p>
<p>通过短视频，给直播间导流，效果非常好。</p>
<p>如果直播比较熟练，还可以投流，投产比大于 1，就能放大操作，收益可观。</p>
<p>投产比持平，也不亏，至少赚个粉丝。<br>
投产比微亏，只要粉丝涨的多，依然不亏。</p>
<p>零成本搭建直播间，采用绿幕直播，找个图书批发素材，作为视频背景。</p>
<p>全程无任何技术含量，OBS+直播伴侣就能搞定。</p>
<p>直播间货源非常简单，直接从精选联盟找，零成本，零库存，赚佣金。</p>
<p>许多书都是白菜价，引流效果非常好。</p>
<p>1、卖家为了提高销量，让更多人帮忙卖货，会低价冲销量，这是常规操作。</p>
<p>2、进入产品页面，会发现不同价格的套餐，低价是引流款，高价是利润款，只要购买的人足够多，利润款足以覆盖引流款的损失，还能有盈余。</p>
<p>用脑残视频，吸引脑残进入直播间。<br>
通过投付费流量，提高直播间数据。<br>
用白菜价产品，吸引韭菜。<br>
用利润款产品，提高收益。</p>
<p>这么一个直播间，销量如何？</p>
<p>月销 5W 单+</p>
<p>整体操作框架就是这样，没什么技术含量。</p>
<p>一张背景图片，随便复制烂大街的鸡汤，几分钟就能搞一个视频。</p>
<p>这种辣鸡视频，都能播放量过万&hellip;.</p>
<p>唯一的缺陷是，97%是系统推流，一旦发其他领域的内容，播放量直接降到几百。</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The business world has many people playing zero sum games and a few playing positive sum games searching for each other in the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealth creation is an evolutionarily recent positive-sum game. Status is an old zero-sum game. Those attacking wealth creation are often just seeking status.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Think about what product or service society wants but does not yet know how to get. You want to become the person who delivers it and delivers it at scale. That is really the challenge of how to make money. Now, the problem is becoming good at whatever “it” is. It moves around from generation to generation, but a lot of it happens to be in technology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most interesting and the most important form of leverage is the idea of products that have no marginal cost of replication. This is the new form of leverage. This was only invented in the last few hundred years. It started with the printing press. It accelerated with broadcast media, and now it’s really blown up with the internet and with coding. Now, you can multiply your efforts without involving other humans and without needing money from other humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever you can in life, optimize for independence rather than pay. If you have independence and you’re accountable on your output, as opposed to your input—that’s the dream. &lt;br&gt;
A leveraged worker can out-produce a non-leveraged worker by a factor of one thousand or ten thousand. With a leveraged worker, judgment is far more important than how much time they put in or how hard they work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wealth is the thing you want. Wealth is&lt;br&gt;
the factory, the robots, cranking out things. Wealth is the computer program that’s running at night, serving other customers. Wealth is even money in the bank that is being reinvested into other assets, and into other businesses. Even a house can be a form of wealth, because you can rent it out, although that’s probably a lower productivity use of land than some commercial enterprise.&lt;br&gt;
So, my definition of wealth is much more businesses and assets that can earn while you sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s ownership versus wage work. If you are paid for renting out your time, even lawyers and doctors, you can make some money, but you’re not going to make the money that&lt;br&gt;
gives you financial freedom. You’re not going to have passive income where a business is earning for you while you are on vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without ownership, your inputs are very closely tied to your outputs. In almost any salaried job, even one paying a lot per hour like a lawyer or a doctor, you’re still putting in the hours, and every hour you get paid.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>Without ownership, your inputs are very closely tied to your outputs. In almost any salaried job, even one paying a lot per hour like a lawyer or a doctor, you’re still putting in the hours, and every hour you get paid.</p>
<p>Without ownership, when you’re sleeping, you’re not earning. When you’re retired, you’re not earning. When you’re on vacation, you’re not earning. And you can’t earn nonlinearly.</p>
<p>Essentially, you’re working for somebody else, and that person is taking on the risk and has the accountability, the intellectual property, and the brand. They’re not going to pay you enough. They’re going to pay you the bare minimum they have to, to get you to do their job. That can be a high bare minimum, but it’s still not going to be true wealth where you’re retired but still earning. [78] Owning equity in a company basically means you own the upside. When you own debt, you own guaranteed revenue streams and you own the downside. You want to own equity. If you don’t own equity in a business, your odds of making money are very slim. You have to work up to the point where you can own equity in a business. You could own equity as a small shareholder where you bought stock. You could also own it as an owner where you started the company. Ownership is really important.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Seek wealth, not money or status.&lt;br&gt;
Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep.&lt;br&gt;
Money is how we transfer time and wealth.&lt;br&gt;
Status is your place in the social hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignore people playing status games.&lt;br&gt;
They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re not going to get rich renting out your time.&lt;br&gt;
You must own equity—a piece of a business—to gain your financial freedom.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seek wealth, not money or status.<br>
Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep.<br>
Money is how we transfer time and wealth.<br>
Status is your place in the social hierarchy.</p>
<p>Ignore people playing status games.<br>
They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.</p>
<p>You’re not going to get rich renting out your time.<br>
You must own equity—a piece of a business—to gain your financial freedom.</p>
<p>You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.</p>
<p>Pick an industry where you can play long-term games with long-term people.</p>
<p>The internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven’t figured this out yet.</p>
<p>↓ Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.<br>
↓ Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity.<br>
↓ Don’t partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling.<br>
↓ Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.<br>
↓ Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage.<br>
↓ Specific knowledge is knowledge you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else and replace you.<br>
↓ Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now.<br>
↓ Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others.<br>
↓ When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, not schools.<br>
↓ Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.<br>
↓Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage.<br>
↓ “Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.” —Archimedes<br>
↓ Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people, and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).<br>
↓ Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge with accountability and show resulting good judgment.<br>
↓ Labor means people working for you. It’s the oldest and most fought-over form of<br>
leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it.<br>
↓ Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.<br>
↓ Code and media are permissionless leverage. They’re the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.<br>
↓ An army of robots is freely available—it’s just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it.<br>
↓ If you can’t code, write books and blogs, record videos and podcasts.<br>
↓Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgment.<br>
↓ Judgment requires experience but can be built faster by learning foundational skills.<br>
↓ There is no skill called “business.” Avoid business magazines and business classes.<br>
↓ Study microeconomics, game theory, psychology, persuasion, ethics, mathematics, and computers.<br>
↓ Reading is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.<br>
↓ You should be too busy to “do coffee” while still keeping an uncluttered calendar.<br>
↓Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If outsourcing a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it.<br>
↓ Work as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work.<br>
↓ Become the best in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.<br>
↓ There are no get-rich-quick schemes. Those are just someone else getting rich off you.<br>
↓ Apply specific knowledge, with leverage, and eventually you will get what you deserve.<br>
↓When you’re finally wealthy, you’ll realize it wasn’t what you were seeking in the first place. But that is for another day.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;大目标比小目标更易于实现，因为问题无法完全挡住你看向大目标的视线。&lt;br&gt;
成功人士总是懂得将自己置于一个“必需的”情境，不实现目标，就永远不会快乐。&lt;br&gt;
当你为自己设立了极限，你就会设法达到你的极限。&lt;br&gt;
你不仅仅要对自己的失败承担责任，也要对你的成功承担责任。&lt;br&gt;
你如果认为成功是不可重复的，就失去了提升自我价值的机会。&lt;br&gt;
一个付出 110 ％努力，主动摒弃所有借口的人，势必取得成功。&lt;br&gt;
你需要一位好教练，一位能够借助自身经验最大化地激发你才能的人。&lt;br&gt;
最先关注自身劣势的人是不会得到财富的。&lt;br&gt;
比赛是消极防御还是主动进攻，两者之间有着天壤之别。&lt;br&gt;
多少人失去了生活的乐趣和变得富有的机会，就是因为他们极力想消除自身的劣势。&lt;br&gt;
你必须为获得财富付出的代价是时间。&lt;br&gt;
但这与你通过财富挣得的时间是不可同日而语的。&lt;br&gt;
财富使你能平心静气地、不带金钱顾虑地思考人生的意义。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;能量贴士通过每天写成功日记来建立自己的自信心。&lt;br&gt;
• 我们的自信心决定了我们是否敢于冒险。&lt;br&gt;
• 不去冒险便不可能获得成长。&lt;br&gt;
• 我们的思想意识、我们受到的教育、我们周围的环境，总体来看不利于我们自信心的培育。健全的自我评估意味着自信。成功日记会使你意识到自己有多优秀。&lt;br&gt;
• 写日记时，你学会了去注意自己的长处。&lt;br&gt;
• 在一段时间之后，你就会开始发现自己的长处并想：这件事我可以把它写进我的成功日记里。&lt;br&gt;
• 我们的期望决定我们会获得什么。我们的自信又决定我们的期望。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;如果你只是带着试试看的心态，那么你最后只会以失败而告终，你会一事无成。尝试纯粹是一种借口，你还没有做，就已经给自己想好了退路。不能试验，你只有两个选择——做或者不做。太多的人做事犹豫不决，就是因为他们觉得没有完全弄懂一样东西。而真正付诸实施要比纯粹的思考要聪明多了&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wealth is the thing you want. Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep. Wealth is the factory, the robots, cranking out things. Wealth is the computer program that’s running at night, serving other customers. Wealth is even money in the bank that is being reinvested into other assets, and into other businesses.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>杠杆有三种</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;第一种是劳动力杠杆，也就是让别人给你打工。劳动力杠杆是一种最古老的杠杆，但在现代社会，这种杠杆的效果并不是最好的。 [1] 我甚至认为这是一种最落后的杠杆。因为管理他人是一件非常复杂、极具挑战的工作，需要高超的领导技巧，弄不好管理者会落个众叛亲离、被手下生吞活剥的下场。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>资本是第二种相对较好的杠杆形式。资本杠杆就是用钱来扩大决策的影响力。 [1] 资本是一种更现代的杠杆形式，利用资本杠杆有一定的难度，需要一定的技能。在 20 世纪，人们曾经利用资本杠杆获得了惊人的财富。资本杠杆是 20 世纪杠杆的主要形式。遍览最富有的人群，你就会发现，最有钱的人是银行家，是腐败国家的政客，他们本质上都是可以动用大量资金的人。再看看大型公司的高层，除了科技公司，绝大多数老牌大型公司的首席执行官其实都在做财务工作。资本杠杆的放大效应非常明显。管理资本要比管理人更容易，因为随着资本的不断增长，其管理难度会远远低于管理不断扩张的团队。</p>
<p>最后一种杠杆是最新出现的，也是普通人最触手可及的。这种杠杆就是“复制边际成本为零的产品”。其中包括书籍、媒体、电影、代码。在所有不需要他人许可就能使用的杠杆中，代码可以说是最强大的一种 —— 只需要一台计算机就够了。</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;而编程、写书、录播客、发推特、拍视频这些事情不需要经过任何人的许可。由此可见，新杠杆就像一个均衡器，极大地缩小了人与人之间的差距，让社会变得更平等。 [78] 比如，每个出色的软件开发者现在都有一大群机器人在为其工作。写好代码后，这些机器人就开始工作，在开发者睡觉的时候也在为其赚钱。 [78] 靠出租自己的时间是永远无法致富的。&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;无论处于人生的哪个阶段，努力的目标都是不断提高自己的独立性，而不是升职加薪。拥有独立性，为自己独特的产出成果负责（而不是像打工一样为投入的时间负责），这才是最理想的状态。&lt;/p&gt;</description>
